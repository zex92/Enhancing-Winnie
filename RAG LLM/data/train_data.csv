"In the case of Nasr v NRMA Insurance [2006] NSWSC 1018, why was the plaintiff's appeal lodged out of time?","In Nasr v NRMA Insurance [2006] NSWSC 1018, the plaintiff's appeal was lodged out of time because the summons was filed on 8 June 2006, seven months after the decision of the Local Court was made on 4 October 2005. No explanation was provided for this delay.",new_south_wales,Nasr v NRMA Insurance [2006] NSWSC 1018," 3 The plaintiff claims that he was overseas when the Local Court struck out his case against the NRMA and they (the NRMA) rejected payment of his claim for his car after it was burnt on 6 July 2004. There are no grounds of appeal in his summons but it may be that he could have submitted that he was denied procedural fairness or natural justice. 4 This appeal has been lodged out of time. The decision of the Local Court was made on 4 October 2005. The summons was filed on 8 June 2006, some seven months out of time. No explanation has been provided for this delay. In these circumstances this Court cannot grant an extension of time in which to lodge this appeal. The Local Court proceedings 5 The Local Court file was not before this Court. There are four letters from the Local Court in evidence. The statement of claim is not before this Court. However, it seems that Mr Nasr sued the NRMA because it denied to pay a claim he made pursuant to his motor vehicle insurance policy and he was seeking damages. Doing the best I can, it appears that Mr Nasr sought and was granted a number of adjournments while he was overseas in China. "
"In the case of R v NGUYEN [2001] NSWCCA 334, what was the relationship between the Appellant and Mr Nguyen, and what activities of Mr Nguyen did the Appellant testify about?","In the case of R v NGUYEN [2001] NSWCCA 334, the Appellant testified that Mr Nguyen was her cousin and that she had allowed him to live in her flat for about 4 or 5 days. She stated that she had heard that Mr Nguyen was selling heroin and that she had seen him hand over a small foil to a third person, an event that made her feel surprised, upset, and angry. Despite her protests, Mr Nguyen allegedly continued to sell heroin from the flat. The Appellant also mentioned seeing other customers in the flat and a friend of Mr Nguyen's cutting foil in the lounge-room. Despite her complaints to her boyfriend and an aunt, she took no further steps to prevent these activities, citing reasons such as their close familial relationship and her reluctance to involve the police.",new_south_wales,R v NGUYEN [2001] NSWCCA 334," 29 The Appellant also gave evidence that she had permitted Mr Nguyen to live in the flat for about 4 or 5 days before the 6th November, because he was her cousin and had nowhere else at that time to live. According to the Appellant, he and sometimes his girlfriend occupied the second bedroom and some others who moved in at the same time slept in the lounge-room. The Appellant said that before Mr Nguyen moved in she had heard that he was selling heroin. On the first day he was with her she saw him hand over a small foil to a third person, an event she said which made her feel, “surprised, upset and angry”. She protested at the event and told Mr Nguyen that if he continued to do that he would have to move out. Nevertheless, according to the Appellant, Mr Nguyen continued to sell heroin and she argued with him nearly every day. Asked how many times she saw other customers in the flat, the Appellant said “Once, twice or three times, I’m not so sure” and “maybe one customer or two customers a day”. A friend of Mr Nguyen’s also cut foil in the lounge-room. 30 According to the Appellant, she complained about Mr Nguyen’s activities to her boyfriend and an aunt, but she took no further steps to prevent those activities. She gave a variety of reasons for this. They included:- He was her eldest cousin and they had been very close. He told her that she should not contact the police. She didn’t want him to go to gaol because he was family and they “were like brothers and sisters”. "

The work was not performed in accordance with the company's documented safety system and the risk was foreseeable. Both the company and the contracted supervisor pleaded guilty. The company had a prior record, while the supervisor did not. The company showed contrition, entered an early plea, and took numerous remedial steps after the accident.

"In the case of Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1329, what was the argument of the Commonwealth regarding the application of habeas corpus and how was it received?","In Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1329, the Commonwealth argued that habeas corpus did not apply as the rescuees were not detained. They contended that for a detention to occur, the detainer must subject the detainee to a total restraint of movement, and that partial restraint or obstruction from going in a particular direction does not constitute detention. They further argued that the rescuees were only prevented from going to their preferred destination and were free to go elsewhere, thus not constituting detention. However, this argument was not accepted by the court, which disagreed with the suggestion that a ""total restraint of movement"" is necessary to constitute detention amenable to habeas corpus.",commonwealth,Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1329," 206 It was submitted for the Commonwealth that habeas corpus did not lie as the rescuees were not detained. For a detention to take place the detainer must subject the detainee to a total restraint of movement. Partial restraint was to be distinguished from detention. To obstruct a person from going in a particular direction, it was argued, does not constitute detention. The rescuees were only prevented from going to their preferred destination. That limited restriction, it was submitted, did not constitute detention given that they were free to proceed to any other destination. It was contended for VCCL and Vadarlis that ""close custody"" is not necessary to attract the remedy of habeas corpus. In the alternative it was submitted that North J was correct to conclude, as a matter of fact, that the restraint upon the rescuees was total. I do not accept the argument for the Commonwealth insofar as it may be taken to suggest that a ""total restraint of movement"" is necessary to constitute detention amenable to habeas corpus."

What is the landlord's general obligation under section 63 of the Act in the case of Anderson v Armitage [2014] NSWCATCD 157 in New South Wales?,"In the case of Anderson v Armitage [2014] NSWCATCD 157, under section 63 of the Act, a landlord in New South Wales is obligated to provide and maintain the residential premises in a reasonable state of repair, considering the age of, rent payable for, and prospective life of the premises. This obligation applies even if the tenant had notice of the state of disrepair before occupying the residential premises.

First, a certification that the documents attached to the certificate (namely the documents comprising the Bundle) - which are then described - 'are submitted in support of the request from Samoa to the Commonwealth of Australia for the extradition of Talalelei Pauga'.

"What is the test for determining a ""genuine"" dispute or claim in the context of section 459H, as interpreted by Australian Commonwealth courts?","The test for determining a ""genuine"" dispute or claim under section 459H, as interpreted by Australian Commonwealth courts, is often phrased as ""whether there is a serious issue to be tried"". The test is not a particularly high one, but the court must be satisfied that there is a claim that may have some substance. This interpretation has been the subject of much judicial consideration, as seen in cases such as Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd, Scanhill Pty Ltd v Century 21 Australasia Pty Ltd, Chadwick Industries (South Coast) Pty Ltd v Condensing Vaporisers Pty Ltd, Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd, and Chase Manhattan Bank Australia Ltd v Oscty Pty Ltd.",commonwealth,Cromwell (Australia) Pty Ltd Carlo Interiors Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 825,"The references in s 459H to the Court’s being “satisfied” that there is a “genuine” dispute, and “satisfied” that the company has a genuine claim against the person who served the demand on it, have been the subject of much judicial consideration: see, for example, Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 11 ACSR 362; Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601; Scanhill Pty Ltd v Century 21 Australasia Pty Ltd (1993) 120 ALR 173; Chadwick Industries (South Coast) Pty Ltd v Condensing Vaporisers Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 37; Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd 12 ACSR 785; Chase Manhattan Bank Australia Ltd v Oscty Pty Ltd 17 ACSR 128. Their meanings have been illuminated by the drawing of analogies with applications for injunctions and extensions of caveats in that the test is often phrased as “whether there is a serious issue to be tried”.

What were the charges against the applicant in the case of R v Perry [2000] NSWCCA 375 in New South Wales?,"In the case of R v Perry [2000] NSWCCA 375, the applicant was charged under s196(b) of the Act for the first fire she admitted to lighting with the intention of killing another resident. She was also charged under s195(b) of the Act for the second fire she admitted to lighting and leaving the premises without waking the other resident.",new_south_wales,R v Perry [2000] NSWCCA 375," 10 On the following day, the applicant, who of course had not been in the premises when she was being searched for, said that two young males had lit the first fire and that she had seen them run away. She said that she had left the premises, caught a bus to Circular Quay and another bus to Malabar to spend the night at her boyfriend's place. She denied knowledge of the second fire. 11 In November 1997, in the course of an interview in relation to later fires, the applicant made full admissions that the first fire on the porch had been lit by her with the intention of killing the other resident. The applicant also admitted that she lit the second fire, and that she had left the premises without waking the other resident. The first fire gave rise to the charge under s196(b) of the Act, the second incident being the basis of the s195(b) charge. 12 Early in the morning of Saturday 8 March 1997, the fire brigade attended premises at Birrell Street, Bondi, concerning a fire in a building. It was a large fire requiring six fire units to bring it under control, just after 7am. The building, which was used to house the Eastern Sydney Developmental Disability Service, did not provide accommodation and was vacant, the building having been locked the evening before. The building had extensive electronic equipment which was valued at approximately $1 million. Something of the order of $2 million was paid out on insurance to cover the damage. "
"In the context of the Anti-Discrimination Act (AD Act) in New South Wales, how is the term ""incite"" interpreted in relation to the offence of serious racial vilification?","In the case of John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd -v- Kazak (EOD) [2002] NSWADTAP 35, it was argued that the term ""incite"" in section 20D(1) of the Anti-Discrimination Act, which creates the offence of serious racial vilification, requires an intention to incite. This interpretation is established by authority with respect to criminal offences relating to incitement. However, the same term in other provisions of the Act may not be construed in the same way, as the context within which the word ""incite"" appears in different provisions of the Act can affect its interpretation. The presumption that the same word is intended to have the same meaning in each case is of little weight and readily yields to the statutory context.",new_south_wales,John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd -v- Kazak (EOD) [2002] NSWADTAP 35," 6 The Appellant’s argument turns primarily on the use of the word ""incite"" in s 20D(1), which creates the offence of serious racial vilification. It is submitted that the use of the same term in both provisions demands a consistent construction, that is, if it is accepted that s 20D requires an intention to incite (a proposition which is unarguably established by authority, with respect to criminal offences relating to incitement), then ""incite"" in s 20C must be similarly construed. Whilst it is a principle of statutory construction that the same word appearing in a statute should be consistently construed, the Appellant’s argument discounts the context within which the word ""incite"" appears in a number of provisions in the AD Act. The presumption that, where the same word is used on more than one occasion in a provision, it is intended to have the same meaning in each case, is one of little weight which ""readily yields"" to the statutory context : Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 150 CLR 1 at 15 ; see also Murphy v Farmer (1988) 79 ALR 1 at 7. 7 Section 20D(1) provides :- A person shall not, by a public act, incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of, a person or group of persons on the ground of the race of the person or members of the group by means which include [threatening or inciting others to threaten physical harm].

What was the final decision of the court in the case of Colbron v Freeman (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1528 in New South Wales?,"In the case of Colbron v Freeman (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1528, the court decided that the appeal should be allowed; the judgment entered against Mr Colbron in the Local Court should be set aside and the proceedings against him dismissed. The court also ordered that Mr Freeman should pay Mr Colbron's costs as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis up to and including 17 July 2014 and that thereafter Mr Freeman should pay Mr Colbron's costs of the appeal as agreed or assessed on the indemnity basis.",new_south_wales,Colbron v Freeman (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1528,"12I have also to have regard to two letters sent by Mr Colbron to Mr Freeman prior to the hearing of the proceedings in the Local Court, the first dated 27 May 2013 offering that Mr Colbron would bear his own costs if the proceedings were dismissed, and the second offering dated 29 August 2013 that Mr Colbron would pay Mr Freeman the amount of $3,600 and pay one quarter of his costs on a party party basis. That second letter set out in detail Mr Colbron's complaints about Mr Freeman's fee notes which were the subject of the underlying dispute. 13Leaving aside any other considerations, those two letters would form a proper basis for Mr Colbron to have his costs on the indemnity basis. Against that consideration, however, I have to have regard to the practice note and the remarks of the Magistrate to which I have referred. An award of indemnity costs on the basis of a Calderbank offer is not mandatory. The Court must always take all circumstances into account and act in accordance with the dictates of justice. In all the circumstances, I consider the appropriate order to be that Mr Freeman pay Mr Colbron's costs of the proceedings below as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis. 14The orders I propose, accordingly, are that the appeal be allowed; that the judgment entered against Mr Colbron in the Local Court be set aside and the proceedings against him dismissed; that Mr Freeman pay Mr Colbron's costs as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis up to and including 17 July 2014 and that thereafter Mr Freeman pay Mr Colbron's costs of the appeal as agreed or assessed on the indemnity basis."

"In the case of Angela Therese Harvey (nee Alecci) v Eileen Therese Alecci & Anor [2002] NSWSC 898, what was the court's decision regarding the order for mediation?","In the case of Angela Therese Harvey (nee Alecci) v Eileen Therese Alecci & Anor [2002] NSWSC 898, the court decided not to order a mediation due to the state of enmity within the family. The court deemed that ordering a mediation would not be a viable, possible, responsible, or a proper exercise of the court's discretion.",new_south_wales,Angela Therese Harvey (nee Alecci) v Eileen Therese Alecci & Anor [2002] NSWSC 898," 29 For those reasons and notwithstanding my usual view, which would be that in most family circumstances it would be a very useful thing to order a mediation, the state of enmity of this family is not such, it seems to me, as makes that course viable, possible, responsible or a proper exercise of the Court’s undoubted discretion by compulsory order to order a mediation. For those reasons and in those circumstances, the orders sought in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the motion will not be made, and an order is made in the following terms. 30 I order that pursuant to paragraph 5.5A of the order dated 26 June 2002 there be retained the amount of $400,000 of the first defendant’s share of the proceeds of sale of the land described in paragraph 5.5A of the order dated 26 June 2002, which sum of $400,000 is to be retained on the same terms as presently appear in paragraph 5.5A. Otherwise, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the notice of motion filed on 17 September 2002 are dismissed. 31 In relation to costs of the notice of motion, Mr Harris has sought an order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the notice of motion. Mr Burton has conversely sought an order that all or part of the costs of the motion be paid by the defendants. "
"In the case of Singh v MIMA [1998] FCA 1240, what was the main argument presented by the applicant for review of the Refugee Review Tribunal's decision?","In the case of Singh v MIMA [1998] FCA 1240, the applicant sought a review of the Refugee Review Tribunal's decision on the basis that the Tribunal did not take into proper consideration the merit of the case as per the applicant's specific situation. The argument focused on the manner in which the Tribunal disposed of the credit of the applicant, which it considered was significantly damaged by the inconsistency between the period he said he had been in detention, and the evidence he gave before the Tribunal.",commonwealth,Singh v MIMA [1998] FCA 1240,"EX TEMPORE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT In this matter the applicant seeks a review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. The application states a number of grounds, but was presented in argument solely on the basis of ground 8, which reads: “The Respondent did not take into proper consideration the merit of the case as per the Applicant's specific situation.” I pass over the purely technical solecism in the reference to the respondent, because it is the decision of the Tribunal which is said not to have taken this matter into proper consideration. The argument focussed, then, on the manner in which the Tribunal disposed of the credit of the applicant, which it considered was significantly damaged by the inconsistency between the period he said he had been in detention, when making his original claims to departmental officers which referred to a period of five months detention, and the evidence he gave before the Tribunal, which referred to three periods of detention, the longest of which was six weeks and the other two apparently much shorter. The Tribunal also doubted his credit because of a reference to a leader of the Sikh movement with which he was concerned, one Amriq Singh. The Tribunal challenged him about his evidence concerning Amriq Singh on the footing that Amriq Singh, according to material available to the Tribunal, although he was indeed a significant leader, had been killed as far back as 1984."
"In the case of Carvajal v Lamba [2019] NSWDC 284, did the court draw any adverse inference against the plaintiff for not mentioning certain details about the accident in her initial descriptions?","In Carvajal v Lamba [2019] NSWDC 284, the court did not draw any adverse inference against the plaintiff for not mentioning that the defendant was coming in the opposite direction and drove across her path, or that her dog was in the car in her initial descriptions of the accident. The court reasoned that there was no need to include these details in the forms she signed as they only requested the description of the accident, not the events leading up to it. Furthermore, the court found that what was recorded in the forms and the histories by the doctors was completely consistent with the version of the accident given by the plaintiff in her sworn evidence.",new_south_wales,Carvajal v Lamba [2019] NSWDC 284,"14. It was put to the plaintiff that she had given different versions of the accident in the two forms and in a history to doctors. In particular, it was put to the plaintiff that she had not, in those descriptions, talked about the defendant coming in the opposite direction and driving across her path. Nor had she mentioned that her dog was in the car. I do not draw any adverse inference against the plaintiff because those matters were not in the descriptions of the accident about which she cross-examined. In the two forms which the plaintiff signed as true and correct, there was no reason to include those matters, as the forms only requested the description of what happened in the accident, and not the events leading up to it. So far as the histories recorded by doctors were concerned, there was no evidence as to whether those histories came from assumptions which the doctors were asked to make, or from what the plaintiff said to the doctors. In any event, what is recorded in the two forms, and what is recorded in the histories by the doctors, is completely consistent with the version of the accident given by the plaintiff in her sworn evidence."
What were the considerations taken into account by the Court of Appeal in the case of Collins v The Queen [2018] HCA 18 to conclude that the prosecution case was strong and guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt?,"In the case of Collins v The Queen [2018] HCA 18, the Court of Appeal considered three main considerations to conclude that the prosecution case was strong and guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. First, despite some inconsistencies in the complainant's account, the complainant had given ""a relatively robust and unvarying account of the essential features of the conduct making up the offences"". Second, the physical evidence of the clippers supported parts of the complainant's account. Third, preliminary complaints had been made not only to Ms M but also to AJ and Ian Haberfield. The Court of Appeal also noted that the two aspects of the 2007 account that were inconsistent with Ms M's evidence in chief were not put to the complainant in cross-examination, and the complainant's account of the telephone call was not challenged. The Court of Appeal stated that the lack of challenge to the complainant's account of the telephone call considerably weakened the proposition that the jury was deprived of the chance to consider the 2007 account in assessing the complainant's evidence.",commonwealth,Collins v The Queen [2018] HCA 18," The Court of Appeal considered that the prosecution case was a strong one and their Honours were satisfied that guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The conclusion took into account three considerations. First, while there were inconsistencies in the complainant's account, these were largely with respect to matters of peripheral detail and otherwise the complainant appeared to have given ""a relatively robust and unvarying account of the essential features of the conduct making up the offences"". Secondly, the conclusion took into account the physical evidence of the clippers, which ""supported parts of [the complainant's] account"". And, thirdly, the conclusion took into account that preliminary complaints had been made not only to Ms M but also to AJ and Ian Haberfield. The Court of Appeal separately identified one further consideration: the two aspects of the 2007 account that were inconsistent with Ms M's evidence in chief were not put to the complainant in cross-examination. Further, their Honours noted that the complainant's account of the telephone call was not challenged. Absent challenge to that account, the Court of Appeal said that the proposition that the jury was deprived of the chance to consider the 2007 account in assessing the complainant's evidence was ""considerably weakened"".

This externally manifested communication of an irrevocable commitment by the Director might be to her staff or others, or by the giving of notice as required by s 88A(4). Everything which occurs before either of these events does not involve the Director “making up” the Director’s mind because such acts, of necessity, are not final and are not irrevocable. They are subject to change as and when the Director determines within the period of one month provided for the making of the decision.",commonwealth,Amir v Director of Professional Services Review [2021] FCA 745,"42 This said, the better resolution of the potentially competing considerations, in my view, is to construe “decide” in s 88A(1) as meaning an externally manifested communication by the Director of an irrevocable commitment by her whether or not to undertake a review.

The Council did this by email on 6 August and provided a larger copy by courier to their home on 12 August.",new_south_wales,Artz 2 Design Pty Limited v Ku Ring Gai Council [2015] NSWLEC 1380,"17. According to Mr McInnes, who is the Council’s Executive Assessment Officer, the Council’s policy did not require the notification of the most recent amendments because they improved impacts. Despite that, in this case the Council instructed its solicitor to provide the amended plans to the objectors; in particular, Mr and Mrs White. It did so by email on 6 August and provided a larger copy by courier to their home on 12 August. As already noted the Whites reside behind the development site on a battle axe block at 5a Wonga Wonga Road and a part of their driveway affords access to the applicant’s land. 18. The Whites initially engaged a solicitor, Mr PJ Ellis for the purpose of lodging two written submissions opposing the development. The first submission was dated 3 July 2014 and related to the original plans. The second submission was dated 24 June 2014 and related to the subsequent design. The Whites’ submissions are before the Court and have been read (Exhibit 1). Since the date of those submissions they have also liaised directly with the Council and its solicitor in respect of the development of the applicant‘s land. 19. Relevantly, Mr and Mrs White were also involved in the s 34 conciliation conference which I facilitated between the parties in respect of the original design. With the consent of the applicant Mr White (together with other objectors) addressed the conference at the onsite meeting and explained their particular concerns. The plans prepared after the conference were responsive to those concerns and as a result the additional townhouse which the Whites complained of was removed from the design. This redesign of the development together with some other changes to setback and landscaping largely resolved the objectors’ concerns."

Mr Vezgoff also carried out a Tree Risk Assessment based on a method published by Matheny & Clark, one of the methods used by the arboriculture industry. Mr Harradence takes issue with the result and questions the inputs into the formula; Mr Harradence considers the rating should be higher. The matter was discussed during the hearing but little turns on it. 11. In June 2017 Mr Harradence engaged Mr Peter Richards, a consulting arborist, to prepare a report. Mr Richards’ report is included in Exhibit A. The report is very light on specific detail and relies heavily on generic appendices. While I note that the report was obtained prior to the filing of the Class 2 application, I also note that the report does not take a conventional format and would not comply with the Expert Witness Code of Conduct in Schedule 7 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005. 12. In the summary on p 4 of his report Mr Richards states that the tree exhibits symptoms of decline and structural deterioration though ‘sudden branch drop’ with branches having failed recently. He states that branch failure has allegedly become more frequent over recent years as several limbs have failed. Mr Richards writes “The subject tree is passing maturity when instances of Sudden Branch Drop usually become more prevalent”. He opines that the tree is stressed because of the production of epicormic growth. On the basis of these assumptions, Mr Richards recommends the removal of the tree. Mr Richards was not required by either party to attend the hearing. 13. Mr Harradence stated that the suggestion for the creation of dead habitat tree came from another arborist who had undertaken tree work on his property."

They are void (apart from the relief now being considered) because they were reversionary leases. One of the provisions of the Act of 1895 (sec. 26, provision i.) forbids reversionary leases. Therefore these leases were void because of the breach or non-observance of that provision. It is to be observed that both sec. 26 and sec. 44 use the word "" provision,"" in the former case to restrict the power of leasing, in the latter case to excuse what has been wrongly done. The latter section seems to have the former in view. Accordingly, sec. 44 applies to this case, and these leases are voidable, and are not to be held void, though thev would have been so but for sec. 44.

What were the two main issues for determination by the court in the case of Mark Gerstl & Associates Pty Ltd v Waverley Council [2004] NSWLEC 633?,"In the case of Mark Gerstl & Associates Pty Ltd v Waverley Council [2004] NSWLEC 633, the court had to determine two main issues. The first issue was whether the proposal would be satisfactory in terms of streetscape and character, particularly in the context of the provisions of the Development Control Plan No. 2 - Dwelling House Development and Development Control Plan No. 20 - Dual Occupancy Provisions. The second issue was related to the proposed relatively large balconies at the ground floor level and whether those balconies would have any adverse amenity impacts.

Also relevantly applicable are Development Control Plan No. 2 - Dwelling House Development and Development Control Plan No. 20 - Dual Occupancy Provisions (""the DCP’s""). 5. The application was advertised and two submissions were received, one from the Bronte Beach Precinct Committee and the other from No. 2 St Thomas Street. The precinct committee was concerned that: the proposal does not comply with the requirements of the applicable DCP's; the proposed flat roof would be out of character with the street; and the building would be contrary to the Bronte character study. Ms V Milson the convenor of the committee elaborated on these concerns at the hearing. 6. The conditions of consent having been agreed between the parties the remaining two issues for determination by the Court involve firstly whether the proposal would, in terms of streetscape and character be satisfactory, particularly in the context of the provisions of the DCP’s. Here, issues relating to floor space ratio, building height and setbacks are relevant. 7. The second issue relates to the proposed relatively large balconies at the ground floor level and whether those balconies would have any adverse amenity impacts. There was also some little concern that those balconies might contribute to the bulk and scale of the buildings. "

"In the case of Smartways Logistics Holdings Pty Ltd v O’Sullivan [2020] NSWSC 189, what was the court's finding regarding the access and use of Smartways' confidential information by Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Leahey?","In the case of Smartways Logistics Holdings Pty Ltd v O’Sullivan [2020] NSWSC 189, the court found that Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Leahey accessed Smartways’ confidential information during their employment, specifically in the period just before they both left the company. The court accepted the submission that such access was for the purposes of use in the setting up of a rival business, Just-Medical Logistics. The court found that the information they accessed was used by them for purposes that were not related to their employment at Smartways, which was incompatible with the fulfilment of their express contractual duties.",new_south_wales,Smartways Logistics Holdings Pty Ltd v O’Sullivan [2020] NSWSC 189,"Findings of breach during their employment 120. Smartways submits that the nature and timing of their access to Smartways’ confidential information during the period immediately before they resigned leads to the inescapable conclusion that such access was for the purposes of use in the setting up of Just-Medical Logistics. I accept that submission. 121. The evidence outlined above establishes that a range of Smartways’ Confidential Contact and Business Method Information was accessed by Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Leahey while they were employed by Smartways in the period just before they both left. Mr Wyborn’s evidence suggests that there were no good reasons for them to have accessed the types of information at the times they did to fulfil their duties at Smartways. 122. In the absence of any explanation by Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Leahey as to any legitimate business need, I consider it open on the evidence to find that the information they accessed was used by them for purposes that were not related to their employment at Smartways. The intensity of the contact during the period after Mr O’Sullivan resigned and the terms of the text messages between Ms Leahey and Mr O’Sullivan supports that finding, as does the evidence of Mr O’Sullivan’s activities in setting up the rival business (referred to in [63]-[66] above). 123. It is incompatible with the fulfilment of their express contractual duties, the details of which are set out at [49] in relation to Mr O’Sullivan and at [59] in relation to Ms Leahey, to access and use Smartways’ Confidential Contact and Business Method Information to assist in the setting up of a new enterprise unrelated to the Smartways’ business."

"In the context of the Australian Commonwealth jurisdiction, when is a debt considered to be contracted by a company in relation to the purchase of shares?","In the decision of Shapowloff v Dunn [1981] HCA 21, it was concluded that a debt as spoken of in s. 303 (3) was contracted by the company on the date when the broker bought the shares. On that day, the broker began and completed the execution of the company's buying order and the company became liable to indemnify the broker for the purchase price of the shares. This liability was contingent on the delivery of the scrip by the selling broker. Such a contingent liability falls within s. 303 (3) and is enough to constitute a debt falling within that section.",commonwealth,Shapowloff v Dunn [1981] HCA 21," Accordingly I conclude that such a debt as s. 303 (3) speaks of was, in the circumstances of this case, contracted by the company on the date when the broker bought the shares here in question. On that day the broker began and completed the execution of the company's buying order and the company became liable to indemnify the broker for the purchase price of the shares. That liability was contingent, as was the broker's liability to the selling broker, the contingency in both cases being the delivery of the scrip by the selling broker. But such a contingent liability falls within s. 303 (3) and is enough to constitute a debt falling within that section. It is nothing to the point that the amount of the indebtedness may subsequently be reduced by the exercise by the broker of his right to resell the shares and appropriate the proceeds in part satisfaction of the debt. The re-sale value of the shares may, of course, be of considerable relevance in determining whether there existed ""reasonable or probable ground of expectation of the company being able to pay the debt"". For example, any great increase in value of the shares between date of purchase and date of delivery of scrip would no doubt aid in establishing the existence on the part of a company's officer of reasonable grounds of expectation of the company being able to pay the debt, but it would not otherwise be relevant in the application of s. 303 (3)."
"In the context of the New South Wales case JONES v MARTIN [2000] NSWSC 1112, what is the significance of a party's contribution to the other's superannuation entitlements?","In the case of JONES v MARTIN [2000] NSWSC 1112, it was noted that there needs to be evidence that one of the parties had in some way contributed to the other's superannuation entitlements. This contribution could be direct or indirect. If such a contribution is established, it may be considered ""just and equitable"" for an order to be made based on those entitlements. A common example of an indirect contribution would be a partner who stays at home to look after children, thus enabling the other partner to go to work and earn a superannuation entitlement.",new_south_wales,JONES v MARTIN [2000] NSWSC 1112," 29 Powell J at 108 of his judgment referred to the need to establish that one of the parties had in some way contributed to the other's superannuation entitlements and that by reason of that contribution, it was ""just and equitable"" that some order based upon, or derived from, those entitlements should be made. Cole JA dealt with the matter at 118 of his judgment and inclined to the view that there was no evidence in the case to suggest that the appellant had made any contribution, direct or indirect, to the respondent's present superannuation entitlement, it being a deduction from his service pay. He held that a similar situation pertained to the appellant's superannuation. 30 It is not easy to reconcile the different views but it would appear from the comments of Powell J and Cole JA that there must be some factual matter which enables one to form the view that there had been a contribution to a spouse's superannuation entitlements. A common example of this would be a partner who stays at home to look after children thus enabling the other partner to go to work and earn a superannuation entitlement. "

"In the case of Fulton v Chief of Defence Force [2023] FCAFC 134, what were some of the factors considered by the court in deciding whether to grant relief to FLTLT Fulton under s 16 of the ADJR Act?","In the case of Fulton v Chief of Defence Force [2023] FCAFC 134, the court considered several factors in deciding whether to grant relief to FLTLT Fulton under s 16 of the ADJR Act. One factor was the lapse of time since the termination decision was made, which was over two and a half years ago. However, the court did not view this delay as a factor against granting relief as the trial of the proceeding in the original jurisdiction was consensually deferred. Another factor was FLTLT Fulton's repeated failure over a lengthy period to pass a PFT. However, the court found it odd that despite this, FLTLT Fulton was retained in the RAAF for some 18 years, promoted and deployed on operational service, which involved a waiver of a requirement to pass a PFT. The court also noted that there were other instances in FLTLT Fulton’s service history where a requirement to undertake a PFT was deferred for medical reasons. Furthermore, his most recent PPRs (2018 and 2019) did not rate him as unsuitable, rather the reverse.",commonwealth,Fulton v Chief of Defence Force [2023] FCAFC 134,"122 It does not necessarily follow that FLTLT Fulton should be granted relief in the exercise of the power conferred on the Court by s 16 of the ADJR Act. The power to grant that relief is discretionary. 123 One basis upon which relief might be withheld is the sheer lapse of time since the termination decision was made – over two and a half years ago. However, the trial of the proceeding in the original jurisdiction was consensually deferred for reasons set out above. So delay is not, in my view, a factor telling against the granting of relief. 124 A factor which has much troubled me is that adverted to at the commencement of these reasons, repeated failure over a lengthy period to pass a PFT. Yet, reflecting further, it is distinctly odd that, this notwithstanding, FLTLT Fulton was not just retained in the RAAF for some 18 years but promoted and deployed on operational service. Further, that deployment involved a waiver of a requirement to pass a PFT. And there look to be other bases in FLTLT Fulton’s service history in which a requirement to undertake a PFT was at least deferred for medical reasons. Moreover and most importantly in terms of discretion, his most recent PPR, the only ones in evidence (2018 and 2019), do not rate him as unsuitable, rather the reverse."

This refusal was viewed as a repudiation of an essential condition of the contract of employment, providing the applicant company with a valid reason to terminate his employment.",commonwealth,Franklins Ltd v Pearson [1997] IRCA 288,"Pilfering is an obvious risk in the warehouse of a large retail grocer where a large staff is employed. Systems requiring employees’ cooperation must be put in place to seek to minimise pilfering. No sensible employer would fail to do so, and any reasonable employee would concede this. A system had been established here. Thus it was a condition, and a necessary one, that employees should cooperate with the employer’s reasonable security requirements, unless there be some good reason for doing otherwise. In this instance, the established security procedures were reasonable and Mr Pearson’s deliberate refusal to submit to them constituted, in my view, a repudiation of an essential condition of the contract of employment. Accordingly, I find that the applicant company had a valid reason to terminate Mr Pearson’s employment.

"In the case of Nash v Minister Administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 [2007] NSWLEC 624, what was the court's decision regarding the location of the footpath/cycle way along Boomerang Drive?","In the case of Nash v Minister Administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 [2007] NSWLEC 624, the court accepted the council's suggestion to locate the footpath/cycle way on the opposite side of Boomerang Drive. This decision was based on the topography of the nature strip in front of the site and the need to retain existing vegetation along the street frontage. The court amended Condition C34(1) to reflect this requirement.",new_south_wales,Nash v Minister Administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 [2007] NSWLEC 624," 97 Conditions C34(3)(m) and C34(5) relate to the formation of a nature strip and construction of a concrete a footpath/cycle way along the Boomerang Drive frontage. The respondent states that the council is willing to consider locating the footpath/cycle way to the opposite side of Boomerang Drive thereby removing any issues associated with vegetation removal and the 2 m high embankment within the nature strip adjoining the site. 98 I accept that the provision of a footpath/cycle way that extends from the eastern boundary to the western boundary is an appropriate requirement for the proposed development. This will allow any person using the most westerly access to use the footpath/cycle way. Condition C34(5) is amended to reflect this requirement. 99 I also accept that the suggestion of the council that it should be located on the opposite side of Boomerang Drive is a sensible and practical approach to the provision of this facility. The topography of the nature strip in front of the site and the reliance by Ms Gordon on retaining existing vegetation along the street frontage clearly supports the council's suggestion. Condition C34(1) and be amended to reflect this requirement. 100 Conditions C34(3)(n) requires the written agreement of the caravan park for any works within the caravan park property associated with driveway and roundabout construction. The applicant maintains that there is no work on the caravan park site however in the absence of any detail design, the words ""If required"" should be placed at the start of the condition. "
What is the importance of procedural fairness in the context of litigation according to the decision in Seltsam Pty Limited v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208?,"In the decision of Seltsam Pty Limited v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208, it was highlighted that procedural fairness is crucial to both the reality and the appearance of justice. It involves affording a reasonable opportunity to present or meet a case. This opportunity is vital as just outcomes are grounded upon the court or tribunal addressing the issues presented, particularly where litigation proceeds according to the adversary principle. A lack of procedural fairness can occur when an adjudicator hears evidence or receives argument from one side without the knowledge of the other, or refuses to entertain a relevant argument that one party wishes to put. The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, the appearance of fairness has been shattered in a material respect; secondly, the risk of prejudice is enough to warrant concern, regardless of whether the evidence or representations did work to the party's prejudice.",new_south_wales,Seltsam Pty Limited v Ghaleb [2005] NSWCA 208," 4 As to procedural fairness, this judicial obligation is relevantly concerned with affording a reasonable opportunity to present or meet a case (Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at 611[40]). That opportunity is vital both to the reality and the appearance of justice. Just outcomes are grounded upon the court or tribunal addressing the issues presented, particularly where litigation proceeds according to the adversary principle. 5 Where an adjudicator hears evidence or receives argument from one side behind the back of another there will be want of procedural fairness without inquiring into the probative impact of that evidence or representation. The same goes for a refusal to entertain a relevant argument that one party wishes to put, is stopped from putting, and later turns out to have been rejected. 6 The reasons are twofold, tracking the twofold function of the doctrine as identified above. First, the appearance of fairness has been shattered in a material respect. As Lord Denning put it on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Kanda v Government of Malaya [1962] AC 322 at 337-8: The court will not inquire whether the evidence or representations did work to his prejudice. Sufficient that they might do so. The court will not go into the likelihood of prejudice. The risk of it is enough. No one who has lost a case will believe he has been fairly treated if the other side has had access to the judge without his knowing. "
"In the case of Mansfield v Australian Crime Commission [2003] FCA 1059, did the court find that section 30 and subsection (5) authorise the conduct of an examination in contempt of court?","In Mansfield v Australian Crime Commission [2003] FCA 1059, the court found that section 30 and in particular subsection (5) does not by necessary implication authorise the conduct of an examination in contempt of court. The court stated that such an authorisation is not lightly to be inferred.",commonwealth,Mansfield v Australian Crime Commission [2003] FCA 1059," 64 Such a construction would not automatically render an answer, document or thing admissible automatically in the Confiscation proceedings, but would leave them capable of being admitted subject to the normal rules of evidence. The adducing at the examination of some of that evidence, possibly most of it, might well be unlikely to interfere with the administration of justice in those proceedings. But, in my view, there is a real risk of such interference. 65 In my opinion, s 30 and in particular subsection (5) does not by necessary implication authorise the conduct of an examination in contempt of court. As the Full Court said in De Vonk (at 585), such an authorisation is not lightly to be inferred. 66 In my view, the factual circumstances in De Vonk were sufficiently similar to those in the present case for me to apply the same approach taken by the Full Court in that case to the disposition of this case. It may be that I am not technically obliged to do so, but I take that course in any event. 67 In De Vonk the relevant investigation was under s 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I acknowledge the distinction Mr Scholz sought to draw on the basis that in this matter there is an independent examiner with counsel assisting, whereas in De Vonk officers of the Australian Taxation Office were conducting the inquiry. 68 In De Vonk the Commissioner conceded that those officers proposed to inquire into matters which would bear upon three offences with which Mr De Vonk had been charged and that there was a risk that the answers which he would give would tend to incriminate him and in so doing could interfere with the course of justice."

"In the case of Au v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2021] FCA 1240, what was the Tribunal's assessment of the applicant's likelihood of reoffending and its impact on the community?","In the case of Au v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2021] FCA 1240, the Tribunal's assessment of the applicant's likelihood of reoffending was influenced by its evaluation of the applicant's drug habit as the root of his criminal offending. The Tribunal considered that the drug habit remained a current issue. The applicant's prospects of drug rehabilitation were a significant factor in the Tribunal's assessment of his likelihood of reoffending, the potential effect on the community if he did so, and on his ability to re-establish familial relationships in Australia if the visa cancellation was revoked.",commonwealth,"Au v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs [2021] FCA 1240","79 I do not accept the applicant’s submission in support of this ground. The Tribunal’s reasons make plain that it did not regard itself as compelled to ascribe more weight to the primary considerations than the other considerations described in Direction 79. The Tribunal observed at [61] that “generally speaking” it was to give more weight to primary considerations than other considerations under Direction 79. In the result, the Tribunal did give more weight to the primary considerations relevant to the applicant’s case but that was a product of the Tribunal’s own evaluative process of considering and weighing the factors for and against revocation. A key issue for the Tribunal, and one which influenced the way in which it weighed the other considerations, was its assessment of the applicant’s drug habit as the root of his criminal offending and that it remained a current issue. The applicant’s prospects of drug rehabilitation loomed large in the Tribunal’s assessment of his likelihood of reoffending, the potential effect on the community if he did so and on his ability to re-establish familial relationships in Australia if the visa cancellation was revoked. 80 The applicant repeated his submission as to materiality based on the contention that the Tribunal’s decision was finely balanced. For the reasons set out in paragraph 68 above, I do not accept that if the Tribunal erred as alleged in ground 4 that such error was material."
"In the context of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, does a ""C"" mandate confer the nationality of the mandatary on the inhabitants of the territory?","No, a ""C"" mandate does not confer the nationality of the mandatary on the inhabitants of the territory. This point was discussed in the case of Wong Man On v Commonwealth [1952] HCA 27, where it was noted that there seems to be near unanimity among international jurists that a Territory the subject of a ""C"" mandate does not become part of the dominions of the mandatary in such a sense as to confer on the inhabitants the nationality of the mandatary. This view is also supported by the Council of the League's resolutions adopted in April 1923, which state that the inhabitants of ""B"" and ""C"" mandated areas have a distinct status from that of the mandatary's nationals and do not automatically become invested with its nationality.",commonwealth,Wong Man On v Commonwealth [1952] HCA 27,"If the passage quoted from the judgment of Isaacs J. means that the Mandated Territory of New Guinea became, for all purposes, part of the King's dominions (which I gravely doubt, for the inelegant wording of the passage, as reported, strongly suggests to me that something important has been left out), it must, I think, be regarded as at variance with the whole current of authoritative opinion, and Evatt J. so regarded it in Ffrost v. Stevenson [2] . The novel character of the mandatory system inevitably gave rise to many problems and much discussion among international jurists, but one point on which there seems to have been unanimity—or something nearly approaching unanimity—is that a Territory the subject of a ""C"" mandate does not become part of the dominions of the mandatary in such a sense as to confer on the inhabitants the nationality of the mandatary. This is certainly the view which one would be disposed to take prima facie and without authority. In Ffrost v. Stevenson [3] Latham C.J. said:—""The Treaty of Peace, read as a whole, avoids cession of territory to the mandatary, and, in the absence of definite evidence to the contrary, it must, I think, be taken that New Guinea has not become part of the dominions of the Crown"". Oppenheim (International Law, 5th ed. (1937), p. 194) says:—""In April 1923 the Council of the League adopted certain resolutions with regard to the national status of the inhabitants of ""B"" and ""C"" mandated areas, the substance of which is that they have a distinct status from that of the mandatary's nationals and, while not disabled from obtaining individual naturalization from the mandatary, do not automatically become invested with its nationality.

Microsoft also alleged that Business Boost Pty Ltd had authorised the reproduction of the program. Microsoft pointed out that both the reproduction of the work and its authorization are separate and distinct, and infringement in either form is a distinct tort.",commonwealth,Microsoft Corp v Business Boost Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1384," 13 In the present case Microsoft points out that s 36(1) covers authorization of the infringing act as well as performance of the infringing act itself. Both the reproduction of the work and its authorization have been described as being separate and distinct so that infringement in either form is a distinct tort: see WEA International Inc v Haminex Corporation Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 274 at 284 per Gummow J. 14 Microsoft submits that in the present case the reproduction and authorisation of the infringement occurred by the loading and storing of the program on a hard disk and causing it to be loaded therefrom into Random Access Memory (“RAM”) each time the program was launched. 15 Microsoft says that Milosevic has infringed its copyright by installing or authorizing installation of the WINDOWS program onto the hard disks or by turning on the computer. In addition, it alleges that she has authorised the reproduction of the program. 16 With respect to the question whether the launching of a program into RAM from Read Only Memory (“ROM”) can constitute, on the authorities, an infringement, it is fair to say that the question is an open one. In Dyason v AutoDesk Inc (1989) 18 IPR 109, the members of the Full Court adverted to this question. At 141 Sheppard J said:"

This view might perhaps have been placed on the simple and narrow basis that a law made under s. 122 was a law of the Territory concerned and not a law of the Commonwealth within the meaning of s. 80. It seems, however, to have been placed on a much wider basis.

Reference is made to Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal (2002) 190 ALR 601, but as the appellant made no attempt at first instance to establish any facts analogous to those agreed in Muin, the decision in that case cannot assist him: NADR of 2001 v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs (2002) 124 FCR 465. Reference is also made to a number of other cases, however, all of the cases are cited in support of general propositions, and no attempt is made to link the general statements to the particular circumstances of the appellant’s case.

"In the context of the Gilbert v Commissioner for Government Transport [1960] HCA 34 decision, how is the term ""route"" interpreted within the Act?","In the Gilbert v Commissioner for Government Transport [1960] HCA 34 decision, the term ""route"" within the Act is interpreted with varying shades of meaning depending on the context. Sometimes the emphasis is on the way along which buses regularly go, sometimes upon the service to travellers thus provided or upon the right to provide it. The term is used in different contexts in different parts of the Act, emphasizing different aspects of the complex connotation that for the purposes of the Act the word has.",commonwealth,Gilbert v Commissioner for Government Transport [1960] HCA 34,"I cannot see this implication in the Act. The meaning of the word ""route"" does not, I think, occasion any difficulty or lend support to the argument. The word is, no doubt, used with varying shades of meaning in different contexts in different parts of the Act—or perhaps it is more correct to say that differing contexts emphasize different aspects of the complex connotation that for the purposes of the Act the word has. The emphasis is sometimes on the way along which buses regularly go, sometimes upon the service to travellers thus provided or upon the right to provide it. This can be so too in ordinary parlance. A householder asked whether he lives on a bus route knows what is meant. A person licensed to carry on a bus service would know well enough what was meant if he were asked whether his route was proving profitable. Section 158 with its reference to a route being discontinued or being operated by the Commissioner for Government Transport employs expressions that those who are fastidious about words may condemn as jargon. But that does not make its meaning obscure. It is addressed to persons concerned with the administration of the transport system of a metropolis. It occurs among provisions relating to the regulation of that system in the interests of its total efficiency. It has, it seems to me, no application in the circumstances of this case. If the Government were to operate a bus service in such a manner that a private bus service licensed for a particular route could in practice no longer be carried on, then those facts might support an inference that it had been determined by the proper authority that that route should be operated by the Government instead of by the privately-owned service. In that case it would be necessary to consider the effect of the words that the Commissioner "" may cancel the service licence"". But that is not this case. I need say no more than that I entirely agree with what my brother Kitto has said. The decision of"

The Federal Circuit Court failed to consider that the Refugee Review Tribunal acted in a manifestly unreasonable way when dealing with the applicants’ claim and ignoring the aspect of persecution and harm in terms of s 91R of the Migration Act. The Tribunal failed to observe the obligation amounted to a breach of Statutory Obligation. 2. The Federal Judge dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors contained in the decision of the Tribunal.",commonwealth,MZACF v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCA 866,"REASONS FOR JUDGMENT (REVISED FROM TRANSCRIPT) 1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to bring an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (“FCC”) dismissing the applicants’ application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). The Tribunal affirmed the decision of a delegate of the first respondent (“the Minister”) not to grant the applicants Protection (Class XA) Visas. The applicants have not appeared to prosecute their application and the application is opposed by the Minister on the grounds that the applicants have not provided an explanation for the delay in filing their proposed appeal and the proposed appeal is without merit and cannot succeed. For the reasons that follow the application should be dismissed. 2 The applicants are out of time by one day only for the filing of their appeal. In the circumstances, although no explanation was provided by them as to why they were late in filing their appeal, I do not think that the failure to provide an explanation for the delay, as required by r 36.05 of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth), carries any significant weight against the grant of the application. 3 The more significant question is whether there is any merit in the proposed grounds of appeal. The proposed grounds are as follows: 1. The [FCC] failed to consider that the Tribunal acted in a manifestly unreasonable way when dealing with the [applicants’] claim and ignoring the aspect of persecution and harm in terms of s 91R of the [Migration Act]. The Tribunal failed to observe the obligation amounted to a breach of Statutory Obligation. 2.

"In the case of Vella v Mir (No 2) [2019] NSWCATAP 240, what was the court's decision regarding Cathayne's installation of doors?","In the case of Vella v Mir (No 2) [2019] NSWCATAP 240, the court found that Cathayne breached a statutory warranty that it owed to the Mirs as successors in title. The court was satisfied that Cathayne’s installation of doors that allowed water ingress resulted in a dwelling that was not reasonably fit for occupation. Cathayne did not have a s 18F defence to avoid the consequences of its breach, as the work was not done on instructions given by the person for whom the work was contracted to be done contrary to the advice of the defendant or person who did the work. The court concluded that the Mirs have established a claim against Cathayne for breach of statutory warranty.",new_south_wales,Vella v Mir (No 2) [2019] NSWCATAP 240,"48. Cathayne took possession of and installed the doors. In such circumstances, we are satisfied that Cathayne’s installation of doors that allow water ingress is work that resulted in a dwelling that is not reasonably fit for occupation as a dwelling. We find that Cathayne breached a statutory warranty that it owed to the Mirs as successors in title. 49. We find that Cathayne required a s 18F defence in order to avoid the consequences of its breach. It does not have such a defence, as the work was not done “on instructions given by the person for whom the work was contracted to be done contrary to the advice of the defendant or person who did the work, being advice given in writing before the work was done”. We note that Cathayne was aware that the doors “were of a lower quality and were different” to those Cathayne had proposed and expected would be supplied: [82] of the January 2019 Reasons for Decision. 50. Cathayne made no claim against the Vellas in respect of their supply of the doors or otherwise. Whether any application to the Tribunal in the nature of a cross-claim against the Vellas would have been in time given the date of the contract between the parties is not a matter we need to determine. In any event, no claim was made in the Tribunal. Nor (as far as we are aware) was a claim made in another jurisdiction. 51. We conclude that the Mirs have established a claim against Cathayne for breach of statutory warranty in respect of Item 7."

He suggested that alternative designs of louvres could provide neighbour privacy and some outlook for the occupants. He also pointed out that some compromise in amenity is reasonable considering the objective of providing for low-cost housing.",new_south_wales,HBM Cronulla Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2009] NSWLEC 1011," 29 Mr Fletcher agreed that the internal amenity of some of the bedrooms was unreasonably affected because some of the privacy devices were unnecessary. Similarly alternative designs of louvres could not only provide neighbour privacy but also some outlook for the occupants. He also makes the point that some compromise in amenity is reasonable bearing in mind the objective of providing for low-cost housing. 30 In my opinion the present arrangements whilst perhaps not fatal to the application are unsatisfactory and as suggested by Mr Fletcher require more careful attention. Perhaps a boarding house with less accommodation would provide the design flexibility for a better outcome not only in relation to internal amenity but also the other matters that are of concern. Conclusions 31 In his submissions Mr Fraser directed my attention to BGP Properties Pty Limited v Lake Macquarie City Council [2004] NSWLEC 399 where McClelland CJ held that planning decisions must generally reflect an assumption that, in some form, development which is consistent with the zoning will be permitted and that conversely If the zoning is not given weight, the integrity of the planning process provided by the legislation would be seriously threatened. In this context he concluded that in most cases it can be expected that the Court will approve an application to use a site for a purpose for which it is zoned, provided of course the design of the project results in acceptable environmental impacts.

I have conducted my investigations and in the process have received documentation relating to the Bankrupt’s prior involvement with a clinic in Nairobi; 2. The Bankrupt sold his share in the said Clinic to a related party in or around the year 1987; 3. Based on the available documents, it appears that the transfer may have occurred at a fair value and the funds received by the Bankrupt; 4. Considering the time period that has passed since the sale of the Bankrupt’s share in the clinic, I do not intend to conduct any further investigations into this aspect. Furthermore, I have received confirmation from the Bankrupt that he does not earn any overseas income and have no evidence to contradict this statement. Should Creditors have any information in respect of any other assets or believe the disclosure made by the Bankrupt regarding overseas income is incorrect, I request they send written advice to my office at their earliest convenience along with any documentation that would assist me with my investigations further into this aspect. Should I not receive any advice from the Creditors, my investigations in this respect will be deemed complete. E.

The Bankrupt advised that the purpose of the trip was for business and personal reasons. I note the trip is funded by the Bankrupt himself. Given his overall level of disclosed income, this is reasonable. 2. Based on the disclosure made and supporting documents provided by the Bankrupt, the Bankrupt has been granted travel approval with an undertaking to return his passports back to this office within seven (7) days from the date of his return to Australia."

The [Federal Magistrate] failed to [take] into consideration that the Tribunal decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of my circumstances and the consequences of the claim. ii. The Federal Magistrate failed to consider that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the said decision because its ‘reasonable satisfaction’ was not arrived in accordance with the requirements of the Migration Act. 18 The appellant’s father appeared at the hearing assisted by an interpreter. No written submissions were filed on behalf of the appellant, and his father declined the Court’s invitation to make any oral submissions. 19 As to the first ground of appeal, the reasons of the Federal Magistrate reflect that his Honour did consider the extent to which the Tribunal took into account the ‘circumstances and consequences of the claim’. Further, no particulars were provided before this Court or the Federal Magistrates Court in respect of the assertion that the Tribunal’s decision was ‘unjust’ or was made ‘without taking into account the full gravity of my circumstances and the consequences of the claim’.

In this matter the Court is dealing with an application by Mrs Klewer against the District Court, and in particular his Honour Judge Johnson. The history of the matter is this, that Mrs Klewer was involved in an altercation with a Mr Andrew Roland Martin — who is a police officer — on 18 15 March 1994. Mrs Klewer sued Mr Martin in the Local Court and that matter was heard on 22 June 1995. She failed in that case and costs were awarded against her. The amount of costs was $4,500. She then appealed to the District Court, held in Coffs Harbour, and only on the question of costs. She lost that appeal and incurred further costs in that appeal. 20 The amount of the additional costs was $500, as a result of which Mrs Klewer now owes $5,000 by way of costs, aggregating the two orders of the Local Court and the District Court. Her application to this Court is an application by way of prerogative relief, presumably for orders in the nature of certiorari. The only material before the 25 Court to which we can have regard, taking her case even at itshighest, is her affidavit and the judgment of his Honour Judge Johnson, and perhaps the transcript.

"In the case of SZSCD v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2013] FCA 1471, what was the Tribunal's response to the applicant's request for more time to provide her baptism certificate?","In the case of SZSCD v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2013] FCA 1471, the Tribunal indicated that it would consider any evidence or material which it received prior to making a decision. The decision was made three months after the hearing. The applicant had not provided the baptism certificate by the time of the decision, and there was no suggestion that she had received it afterwards.",commonwealth,SZSCD v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2013] FCA 1471,"13 There seems to be an error in the Tribunal’s reasons at [74] where it is said that 18 months had passed in which she had not provided that material. In fact the period from 21 October 2011 was a period of eight months. In any event, at the conclusion of her evidence she requested that the Tribunal allow her time to provide her certificate of baptism. The Tribunal indicated that it would consider any evidence or material which it received prior to making a decision. The decision was made on 21 September 2012, that is, some three months after the hearing. In those circumstances, I can see no basis for the first applicant’s complaint concerning proceedings in the Tribunal. The nature of the proceedings before me is such that no question of an adjournment can arise at this stage. In any event, even now there is no suggestion that she has received the certificate. She says only that she is confident that she will receive it in the next month. There is really no reason for believing that her prospects will have improved. In the circumstances I conclude there are no prospects of success on appeal.

The Applicants enter into the guarantee on their own behalf and as trustee of the Trust: clause 11. “Trust” is not relevantly defined in Item 3 of Annexure “A”, the Schedule. Indeed, this item states that “None is known to the Lender at the date of this Guarantee and Indemnity”. The guarantee is signed by both Applicants. It is submitted that this document is evidence that it was not the intention of the parties that Heavitree hold the property on trust for the Durnfords. Indeed, no trust is known to Wiggins as at the date of the guarantee.

What does Section 118 of the Australian Constitution dictate in relation to State choice of law rules and how does it affect the application of law in cases of intranational torts?,"According to the decision in McKain v RW Miller & Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 56, Section 118 of the Australian Constitution dictates that State choice of law rules must conform to a certain consequence. The law of a State or Territory is applied in another State or Territory not by reason of extended or extraterritorial operation of that State or Territory law, but by operation of the choice of law rule applicable in the State or Territory where the matter falls for adjudication. The conflict of law rules which would otherwise be applied by a court of the forum are modified (or replaced) in their application to torts occurring within Australia in consequence of the effect attributed to Section 118 of the Constitution. This approach creates a unitary national legal system which attributes to the laws of the respective States the function of regulating conduct and things within their respective territories. The laws of the Territories, like the laws of the States, are part of the national legal system and are subject to like limitations on their territorial operation. In cases of intranational torts, the courts of the forum are not troubled by conflicts of law as there are no conflicts. In a particular case, the same relevant part of the national law alone applies to determine substantive liability, the law of the forum contributing only the procedural or adjectival law applicable to the proceedings.",commonwealth,McKain v RW Miller & Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 56," [Section] 118 dictates a consequence to which State choice of law rules must conform.

On this approach, the conflict of law rules which would otherwise be applied by a court of the forum are modified (or replaced) in their application to torts occurring within Australia in consequence of the effect attributed to s. 118 of the Constitution.

Of particular note, the MA has been amended to resolve a key contention pressed by the Respondent. The effect of this amendment is to refine the basement piling methodology to incorporate an extent of bored secant piles in the proximity of an existing neighbouring building. The bored secant piles result in less vibration than driven sheet piles proposed elsewhere in the basement and thereby reduces the risk of damage to the neighbouring structure. 14. The parties agree, and I am satisfied, that the Warringah Local Environmental Plan 2011 (WLEP) is a relevant environmental planning instrument. At the date the DA was granted consent, the site was zoned B2 Local Centre. More recently, the site has been rezoned to E1 Local Centre and the proposed development - characterised as shop-top housing - remains permissible with consent. I am satisfied the amended MA maintains the objectives of both the B2 and E1 zones. 15. The parties agree, and I am satisfied, that all principal development standards of the WLEP are maintained by the amended MA. 16. The parties agree, and I am satisfied, that the amended MA is subject to the provisions of State Environmental Planning Policy (Building Sustainability Index: BASIX) 2004 (SEPP BASIX).

One screen was delivered. The Debtor refused to take delivery of the remaining screen. The debtor paid the plaintiff $3,898.26 in relation to the invoice. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, and having regard to the Debtor’s failure to pay for other items in respect of which it did not accept delivery, the inference the Court draws is that the amount of $3,898.26 is payment for the screen which was delivered by the plaintiff to the Debtor. 37 In relation to the balance owing by the Debtor to the plaintiff under this invoice in the amount of $2,153.48, McMaster’s evidence was that this screen could not be sold to anyone else because it was tailor made for the Debtor and there was otherwise no available market. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s loss as a consequence of the Debtor’s refusal to accept and pay for this screen is $2,153.48. In turn, Goldberg is liable to the plaintiff in this amount. 38 It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from Goldberg the amount of $80,438.08. "
What were the reasons given by Mr. Kemball for killing his case manager in the case R v Kemball [2020] NSWSC 1559?,"In the case R v Kemball [2020] NSWSC 1559, Mr. Kemball stated that he killed his case manager due to an argument about the case manager's holidays in Asian countries.

He had various persecutory delusions about his case manager hurting people and was resentful about his psychiatric care and need for medication.",new_south_wales,R v Kemball [2020] NSWSC 1559," He talks about an altercation with his case manager and this seems intertwined with his resentment and lack of insight into his psychiatric care [and] need for psychiatric medication. He was also resentful about his CTO. He had various persecutory delusions about his case manager hurting people and, in some way, the Balmain police knew about these activities. He alleged the case manager used to go to the Philippines and was the ‘cause of battle zones’. He claimed his case manager was a ‘beast’. When I asked him why he killed his case manager and he stated, ‘We argued about his holidays. In Asian countries. Previous colleagues asked me if I liked snuff (child pornography)’. He also claimed, ‘I thought he (the deceased) was guilty of crimes against humanity’. He claimed he was unsure how he received wounds to his hands and legs and claimed he could not remember the details. He stated, ‘I just remember having a clamp on my leg, someone writing on my forehead, it was like Star Wars. I’m not sure what my situation was, I think it’s been taken care of’. ‘Carl, Stevie Douglas, he can go through people’s sleep and leave a two dollar coin. The way to avoid it was with piggy banks’. When asked why Carl would leave coins he replied, ‘I don’t know, aliens, men in black…Stevie Douglas was Lucifer’. ‘It was still going on, the constant harassment’. When he asked what the harassment was [he] stated, ‘It was blocking my development’. Mr Kemball alleged that he was being harassed ‘by Stevie Douglas and his crew’. ‘I think it was a job, part of being a law enforcer’. He also claimed he was on a mission but when questioned about the mission, he claimed he was worried about his father and keeping him safe."
"In the context of Australian immigration law, what is the significance of the ""real chance"" test and how does it relate to the concept of a ""well-founded fear of persecution""?","In the decision of Buchari v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 432, it was noted that while the ""real chance"" test can be helpful, the Convention actually refers to a ""well-founded fear of persecution"". The Tribunal must address this issue and it is not necessarily problematic if it did not specifically apply the ""real chance"" test. The High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 144 ALR 567 at 576 warned that the term 'real chance' should not be used as a replacement or substitution for 'well-founded', but rather tribunals should apply the language of the Convention. They should bear in mind that a fear of persecution may be well-founded even though the evidence does not show that persecution is more likely than not to eventuate.",commonwealth,Buchari v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 432," 26 It is also necessary to remember that however helpful the “real chance” test may be, the Convention refers to a “well-founded fear of persecution”. Provided the Tribunal has addressed that issue, it is not to the point if it did not specifically apply the “real chance” test. To suggest otherwise is to ignore the express warning of the majority of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo (1997) 144 ALR 567 at 576: “In this and other cases, the tribunal and the Federal Court have used the term ‘real chance’ not as epexegetic of ‘well-founded’, but as a replacement or substitution for it. Those tribunals will be on safer ground, however, and less likely to fall into error if in future they apply the language of the Convention while bearing in mind that a fear of persecution may be well-founded even though the evidence does not show that persecution is more likely than not to eventuate.”"

In about March 1994 Mr Fountas saw one of the applicant's credit card statements in the supporting documentation relating to cheques which were to be signed. Although there was some discussion about the amounts on the statement there was no inquiry by Mr Fountas as to why the respondent should be paying the applicant's credit card bill. Furthermore if the applicant had been engaged in fraud as alleged it is a surprising reaction on his part to dispute the amount of his termination pay because it should have been based on a salary of $59,000.00 per annum. Accordingly I do not think the allegations of fraud are made out in applying the appropriate standard of proof."

What were the two factors identified in support of finding that Ashley James Alchin has shown cause for his release application in the case R v Alchin [2015] NSWSC 2112?,"In the case R v Alchin [2015] NSWSC 2112, two factors were identified in support of finding that Ashley James Alchin has shown cause for his release application. The first factor was the birth of Alchin's first child, who was three months old at the time, which was considered a motivating factor for him to comply with conditional bail. The second factor was the likelihood of a lengthy period on remand awaiting the trial date, during which Alchin would see very little of his child if bail was refused. This was seen as a factor likely to perpetuate the cycle of disadvantage and deprivation notoriously faced in indigenous communities and specifically faced in Alchin's family.",new_south_wales,R v Alchin [2015] NSWSC 2112,"Judgment 1. HER HONOUR: Before the Court is a release application by Ashley James Alchin. He is 32 years of age. The applicant faces a series of charges in respect of which he has bail. He has been refused bail for an offence of aggravated entering a dwelling knowing there were people there. I have been addressed as to the strength of that charge and I accept it is one of word against word in circumstances of conflict between two families or people. 2. The applicant faces a show cause requirement and needs to demonstrate cause why his detention is not justified. Two matters have been identified in support of finding that the applicant has shown cause. One is the birth of the applicant’s first child, who is three months old. That appears to be a matter which would motivate him to comply with conditional bail. 3. Secondly, the matter is an indictable matter which will have to be committed to the District Court and there is a likelihood of a lengthy period on remand awaiting the trial date. During that period the applicant would in all likelihood see very little of the child if bail is refused. That is a factor which seems to me to be likely to perpetuate the cycle of disadvantage and deprivation notoriously faced in indigenous communities and, as a matter of evidence in the material before me, specifically faced in the family of this applicant. If the Court can reasonably impose conditions which are calculated to break that cycle, in my view it should. That is a strong factor in my finding cause shown. 4. I am satisfied that there is a risk that the applicant would commit a serious offence if released on bail having regard to the matters in his history, but it is one which, I think, can be mitigated by conditions requiring him and encouraging him to engage with family life and to continue to engage with medical treatment through the Aboriginal Medical Service."
"In the case of Hometeam Constructions Pty Ltd v McCauley [2005] NSWCA 303, did the court consider the appellant's failure to formally seek an extension of time for rectification work as a breach of contract?","In Hometeam Constructions Pty Ltd v McCauley [2005] NSWCA 303, the court did not consider the appellant's failure to formally seek an extension of time for rectification work as determinative of a breach of contract. The court held that the appellant's failure to make proper claims for variations due to administrative neglect did not affect the enquiry into whether due diligence was shown in actually performing the work.",new_south_wales,Hometeam Constructions Pty Ltd v McCauley [2005] NSWCA 303," 192 Turning to the first way in which the respondent put her case on lack of due diligence, Ms Olsson contended that in the absence of a formal claim for an extension of time pursuant to cl 9.2 in respect of the rectification work, the appellant was in breach of contract when the Works were not completed at the end of 37 weeks. She submitted the primary judge had correctly concluded (at [142]) that the appellant had not made any claim for extension of time in respect of the rectification work. 193 The primary judge did not base her conclusion that Mr McCauley was entitled to issue the Notice of Default on the appellant’s failure to make a formal cl 9 application for an extension of time in relation to the rectification work. It is plain she accepted the appellant was entitled to a reasonable period to allow for the rectification work – which she assessed at 8 weeks (a period the appellant challenges). There was no Notice of Contention seeking to sustain the judgment on the basis that her Honour ought to have taken that course. However this was a matter the respondent strongly urged on the Court and one Ms Olsson informed the Court the respondent had also relied on below. 194 In my view the appellant’s failure to seek a formal extension of time in a case where the issue is whether it performed the Works with due diligence cannot be determinative. The fact that the appellant, through administrative neglect but not neglect in carrying out the work, fails to make proper claims for variations does not affect the enquiry, whether, in actually performing the work, due diligence was shown.

Neither Cini nor Ryan was called to give evidence. It is erroneous to make a finding as to the company's intention or willingness to misrepresent the contractual arrangements with Swaeder without reference to the knowledge of Cini and Ryan. 20 Another reason for requiring the plaintiff to identify the persons behind the alleged representations is that the subjective sense in which the representation was intended by the representee to be understood is an essential enquiry for a claim in fraud. In this respect, the majority in Krakowski said that (at 578, see also at 576-577): In order to succeed in fraud, a representee must prove, inter alia, that the representor had no honest belief in the truth of the representation in the sense in which the representor intended it to be understood.

The court was also influenced by the view that the statement made in open court by the applicant provided a sufficient basis, in terms of affording procedural fairness to respondents, particularly pastoral respondents, for vacating the trial date.",commonwealth,Hill on behalf of the Yirendali People Core Country Claim v State of Queensland (No 2) [2015] FCA 538,"9 The point of all this, then, is that there is a need for time to be given for the respondent parties to seek consequential orders. There is also a need to recognise, as I have said, that there comes a time, in relation to an exercise of judicial power, where an applicant has been afforded all the time that ought to be allowed in terms of procedural fairness and the devotion of public resources to a particular claim by a particular native title group. As I have observed already, that time, in respect of this claim, has, in my view, passed today, having regard to the statement made in open court. 10 It is theoretically possible, and this was the subject of a very particular concern voiced on behalf of pastoral interests, that the applicant might later seek in this case, perhaps if equipped with further resources, to re enliven its claim for native title. Such an application would, of course, have to be dealt with on the merits but against the very particular background that I have described. Further, in granting the adjournment and the vacation of the trial, I have been expressly influenced by the view that, taking into account the interests of all respondents in certainty, the statement made in open court today by the applicant provides a sufficient basis, in terms of affording procedural fairness to respondents, particularly pastoral respondents, for vacating the trial date. In other words, in deciding to vacate the trial date, I am doing that because I have reached a view that the applicant has had its time to prove its case.

He conceded that some of the group members must be called, particularly because some of the causes of action include a personal element such as reliance, causation or damage. However, his argument was that if these ingredients are established in connection with some group members, and the factors of general application are also proved, the applicants will be entitled to findings in their favour on liability. It would then be appropriate to move to the next stage of the trial: a one by one examination of the circumstances of each group member, this member being called to prove reliance or causation, as the case may be, and the precise extent of his or her damage.",commonwealth,"McMullin, Brian and Anor v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd & Ors [1996] FCA 991","Counsel for ICI objected to this proposal. They said their clients' defence would include the claim that the cause of the contamination of the cattle was the mismanagement of Helix by the cross respondents; much of the evidence that would be required to support the cross-claims would, in any event, be required for their clients' defence. This consideration points to the desirability of the cross-claims being tried at the same time as the principal action. But there are problems about that course. The main problem arises from the fact that this is a representative proceeding involving hundreds of group members. The view taken by counsel for the applicants is that it is unnecessary for him to call evidence from each of the group members in order to obtain findings against the respondents. He concedes that some of the group members must be called, if only because some of the causes of action include as an ingredient a personal element such as reliance, causation or damage. But his argument is, and apparently will be at the trial, that if these ingredients are established in connection with some group members, and the factors of general application are also proved, the applicants will be entitled to findings in their favour on liability and it will then be appropriate to move to the next stage of the trial: a one by one examination of the circumstances of each group member, this member being called to prove reliance or causation, as the case may be, and the precise extent of his or her damage."
"In the case of R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289, what was the Crown's complaint about special circumstances and how did the respondent address it?","In the case of R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289, the Crown's complaint about special circumstances was that the finding and the variation of the non-parole period amounted to double counting. The respondent addressed this by asserting that the discount was inadequate and that there were particular factors that warranted a finding of special circumstances. The respondent argued that a fair reading of the judge's remarks would suggest that no double counting can be demonstrated as the issues of a new identity and relocation were taken into account on the question of special circumstances and not otherwise. The respondent also suggested that the 55 per cent discount would, and should, have been higher if this were not so.",new_south_wales,R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289," 59 The respondent also submitted that a proper assessment of the assistance given also answers the Crown's complaint about special circumstances. The Crown's submission is that the finding and the variation of the non-parole period amounted to double counting. If the discount was inadequate, however, as the respondent asserts, then the Crown's complaint of double counting is at least ameliorated if not met entirely. In any event, the respondent argued that there were particular factors that warranted a finding of special circumstances and that a fair reading of his Honour's remarks would suggest that no double counting can be demonstrated: the issues of a new identity and relocation were taken into account on the question of special circumstances and (presumably) not otherwise. The respondent suggests, perhaps with not a little circularity, that the 55 per cent discount would, and should, have been higher if this were not so. 60 The respondent also identified a second significant discretionary matter. The sentence on Count 2 was a head sentence of 11 years and 3 months. As previously mentioned, this suggests a starting point of 25 years having regard to the 55 per cent discount. As the Crown conceded, his Honour had been misled into thinking that a standard non-parole period applied to this offence. The Crown suggests that his Honour in fact ignored this in the end result. The respondent submitted that what his Honour did in fact was to treat the standard non-parole period as a ""guide post to sentencing"". Even if that submission is not made out in terms, the respondent submitted that the head sentence on Count 2 is very high and effectively offsets any complaint raised by the Crown about concurrency and accumulation.

This principle is applicable to written documents generally. However, in the case of a clause that restricts the rights which ordinarily a party would have, the courts tend to look carefully at the precise terms of a document which limit, restrict or release rights, and give effect to such clauses only as far as and not beyond the limits of the clause.",new_south_wales,JOHN DORAHY'S FITNESS CENTRE PTY LTD v BUCHANAN [1996] NSWCA 278,"light of authorities commencing at least from L’Estrange v Graucob [1934] 2 KB 394, signature of a document in these circumstances ordinarily results in the signing party being bound by the conditions in the document: see generally Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 500; Photo 40 Production Ltd v Securicor Ltd [1980] AC 827.

"In Australian law, can a different magistrate adjudicate a case if the hearing has been adjourned?","According to the decision in Martinuzzi v Fair Work Ombudsman [2012] FCA 636, it has been held that a magistrate before whom a case has begun should complete the hearing and determination of it and, if the hearing is adjourned, no magistrate other than the one before whom the hearing commenced can adjudicate. The adjournment is considered an extension of the hearing of the case. However, there are exceptions, such as when a separate issue arises from the earlier proceedings, based upon a separate set of facts, or in respect of which different considerations are brought to bear.",commonwealth,Martinuzzi v Fair Work Ombudsman [2012] FCA 636," It has been held that a magistrate before whom a case has begun should complete the hearing and determination of it and, if the hearing is adjourned, no magistrate other than the one before whom the hearing commenced can adjudicate, the adjournment being an extension of the hearing of the case: R v Smith; Ex parte Stellino [1952] QWN 37. On the other hand, in R v Hermes; Ex parte V [1963] SASR 81 it was held that where an order had been made by a magistrate forbidding the publication of the name of a party or witness “until further order”, another magistrate before whom the proceedings may come has power, in his discretion, to make an order terminating the prohibition of the publication of the name of the party or witness. This case is also distinguishable from the circumstances that arose in R v Marrington (1850) 1 SCR (NSW) App 11; Legge 643 and in Ex parte Ryan (1864) 3 SCR(NSW) 221 where the statute required that there be a hearing before two justices and the same two justices were not present during the whole of the trial: see s 45 of the Justices Act.

What were the charges against the appellant in the case of Allen George WARREN v R [2009] NSWCCA 176 in New South Wales?,"In the case of Allen George WARREN v R [2009] NSWCCA 176, the appellant was charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, malicious wounding with intent, and using a weapon with intent to avoid lawful apprehension.

The appellant refused to open the door and entry to the unit was forced by Officer Folwell. The appellant, who wore only a shirt, rushed forward, swinging his arms around wildly towards Folwell. Folwell took a hold of the appellant’s right arm, and the appellant resisted violently, twisting and trying to push into him. 7 Constable Nixon administered capsicum spray to the appellant and thereafter efforts to decontaminate the appellant were resisted. The appellant spat at Officer Gallucci, and it was this which gave rise to the charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. 8 When Constable Folwell attempted to effect arrest, the appellant struck him to the top of the head with a weapon several times, causing wounds. It was this which led to the major charge of malicious wounding with intent. The weapon had a long wooden handle with the metal head of a wood splitter attached to the end of the handle with glue and copper wire. 9 During the ensuing struggle the appellant continued to swing the weapon, striking another officer in the left arm with the handle of the weapon. This conduct gave rise to the charge of using a weapon with intent to avoid lawful apprehension. The appellant was disarmed and handcuffed. 10 Constable Folwell was taken by ambulance to the John Hunter Hospital. The two lacerations to the top of his head were sutured, with four stitches being placed in each. He also had bruises to the top of his head and forehead, and a bleeding nose and strained neck. "

"What principle does section 427(1)(d) of the Act embody according to the decision in Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs & Anor v Singh, Surjit [1997] FCA 354?","According to the decision in Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs & Anor v Singh, Surjit [1997] FCA 354, section 427(1)(d) of the Act embodies the principle that if an asylum applicant's account appears credible, they should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be given the benefit of the doubt.",commonwealth,"Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs & Anor v Singh, Surjit [1997] FCA 354","The paragraph continues: ""Even such independent research may not, however, always be successful and there may also be statements that are not susceptible of proof. In such cases, if the applicant's account appears credible, he should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be given the benefit of the doubt."" It may be thought that s427(1)(d) of the Act embodied that principle by empowering the Tribunal to act accordingly. Claims of asylum present decision-makers with a difficult task. There are competing interests to be considered. On the one hand the application should be dealt with as quickly as possible, on the other hand the applicant is to be given a fair opportunity to make out the claim. The decision-maker has to assess the credibility of an applicant in circumstances where the whole of the applicant's account necessarily is self-serving and often may have to make the best of disjointed accounts which flow from successive interviews in which the claimant's recollection may be augmented by delayed recollections and the interview procedure may suffer from the need to be translated into and out of the applicant's native tongue. Notwithstanding an overriding prerogative vested in the State to control the right of refugees to seek asylum in this country, the provisions contained in ss427 and 476 of the Act show an intention that, consistent with the conduct of a free society, the rule of law is to be observed and the obligations undertaken by Australia under the Convention for the determination of refugee status are to be carried out by access to due process being accorded asylum claimants. Thus under s420(2) of the Act the delivery of a speedy and efficient review procedure is not to be gained by denial of the rule of law and the Tribunal, however it carries out its functions, must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case."

He also referred to other reports and materials in relation to the orthopaedic injuries sustained by the appellant and I note his observations about that. Those matters, of course, are not relevant to this appeal before the District Court, but what is relevant are the various findings and pronouncements by the learned Chairperson, insofar as the question of shock is concerned.

Specifically, he contended that the IRT did not consider that the breach of visa condition was relatively trivial and that the applicant would suffer hardship if the visa were cancelled.",commonwealth,"Singh, Balwinder v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1562","Did the IRT Err? The substance of Mr Newman’s argument was that the IRT failed to take into account circumstances relevant to the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 116(1) of the Migration Act. In particular, Mr Newman argued that the IRT had failed to take into account that the breach of visa condition was relatively trivial and that the applicant would suffer hardship if the visa were cancelled. It is by no means clear that, even if the applicant’s criticism of the IRT’s reasons were well-founded, it would give rise to a ground of review under the Migration Act: see s 476(2)(e). However, I am prepared to assume that, if the criticism is well-founded, the applicant would be entitled to succeed. The difficulty in the applicant’s path is that, although the IRT’s reasons are brief, I do not think it overlooked the considerations on which the applicant relied. The principles upon which the IRT’s reasons are to be construed are well settled. The Court is not to be concerned with looseness in the language of the reasons of an administrative decision-maker. Nor is it to construe the reasons minutely “with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic (1993) 43 FCR 280 (FC), at 287, applied in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 185 CLR 259, at 272, per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ."

He also found that when a man was being trained on the job, it was usual to pair him with an experienced worker. Mr Justice Wood further opined that had the plaintiff been working with an experienced man or had he been properly instructed or properly supervised, he would have been following the proper practice of standing when using the tongs with his back to the line of the track, not the side of it, and would not have fallen on to the post or rail which caused the damage.",new_south_wales,STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES v DIMITRIJEVIC [1989] NSWCA 192,"today, at the time of the accident, gave new fettlers a week’s training before they began on the job, but that neither the plaintiff nor his workmate had been given 5 such training. He also found that when a man was being trained on the job as distinct from having a week’s training before starting on it, it was usual to pair him with an experienced worker. Having looked through the evidence, each of these findings seems to me to have been justified. Mr Justice Wood’s opinion further was that had the plaintiff 10 been working with an experienced man or had he been properly instructed or properly supervised he would have been following the proper practice of standing when using the tongs with his back to the line of the track, not the side of it, and would not have fallen on to the post or rail which caused the damage. In this Court the defendant disputes the trial judge’s conclusions on various 15 bases which in the oral submissions were, I think, put mainly under three heads. The first basis took as its starting point an observation made by the trial judge in what was a critical part of his judgment. His Honour said in this part, “I am satisfied that had he (ie the plaintiff) been informed of the risks further efforts would have been made to loosen the ballast and that the correct stance would 20 have been taken”. The submission for the defendant was that his Honour was mistaken in thinking that further loosening of the ballast was needed. It was said that evidence had been given by the plaintiff to the effect that all ballast necessary to be moved had been moved before the operation with the tongs began. The 25 submission was then developed that this misunderstanding affected his Honour’s approach to the factual situation in a way that vitiated his conclusion."

His conditions of custody will be harsher than the conditions that apply to the prison population generally. His Honour found that the applicant’s partner and brother each have a basis for fearing for their safety as the result of his cooperation with the authorities.

Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation, trading as WSN Environmental Services [2008] NSWIRComm 1108"," 2 When both issues remained in dispute following conciliation, I issued the certificate of attempted conciliation required by S.135 and lodged it in the prescribed manner, programming the matter for arbitration. In accordance with S.146A, the TWU and WSN have completed a referral agreement in general terms for any industrial disputes between them to be dealt with in the State Commission. Ultimately, I was informed that the dispute between the parties was confined to one issue alone, ie that Mr Okke was not being adequately remunerated when he carried a load exceeding 20 tonnes. That claim involved an interpretation of the relevant provision in the enterprise agreement. I understood that the TWU claim involved could be mounted by the TWU as a small claim under Ss.378 and 380. 3 I was subsequently informed that the remaining matter had also been settled by conciliation and on Friday, 8 February, 2008 I granted the TWU leave to discontinue the proceedings in chambers in accordance with Rule 138. However, the TWU subsequently wrote to me and requested that I reconvene the proceedings. I set the matter down for a further mention on Friday, 18 April, 2008 and was informed by the TWU in those proceedings that both matters in dispute remained unresolved. The parties were to hold further discussions concerning the two matters and I was to reconvene the proceedings on Wednesday, 7 May, 2008. With the consent of WSN, the TWU sought that I vacate those proceedings and I set them down for a further mention on Tuesday, 27 May, 2008, Thursday, 12 June, 2008, Thursday, 10 July, 2008 and Thursday, 4 September, 2008.

"What does Part 9, rule 6 of the Workers Compensation Court Rules 1990 in New South Wales stipulate about the process when there is a dispute over the actual or probable earnings of a worker in a compensation case?","Part 9, rule 6 of the Workers Compensation Court Rules 1990 in New South Wales provides that in any application where the quantum of weekly compensation is or may be an issue and there is or may be a dispute in respect of the actual or probable earnings of a worker during any relevant period, the following provisions shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, have effect: 1. The applicant shall file and serve on each other party not later than twenty-one days before the hearing date a schedule containing full particulars of such earnings during such period. 2. If any party disputes the accuracy of any matter in the schedule, that party shall, not later than seven days after service file and serve a schedule containing its allegations of such earnings.

Cole JA. Two grounds only were argued on appeal subsequent to the filing by consent of an amended notice of appeal. The first ground was that the trial judge’s 15 finding that pre-accident earnings of $300 per week was unsupported by evidence. The second contention was that because there was admitted into evidence a schedule of earnings which showed pre-injury award earnings and actual earnings but left blank the column for comparable earnings and thus the net loss, the effect of Part 9, rule 6 Compensation Court Rules 1990 was to render 20 the pre-injury employment award rates binding on the trial judge. In my judgment, each of those grounds fails. Part 9 rule 6 provides: In any application where the quantum of weekly compensation is or may be an issue and there is or may be a dispute in respect of the actual or probable earnings of a worker 25 during any relevant period, the following provisions shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, have effect: 1.

"In the case of Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166, what was the final decision regarding Mr Escott's beneficial interest in the trust and its impact on Ms Geeves' eligibility for the carer payment?","In the case of Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that Mr Escott's beneficial interest in the trust was an asset within the meaning of s 11 and s 198D of the Act but that it was an excluded trust within the meaning of the amended s 198E. As a result, Ms Geeves was entitled to the carer payment at the time of cancellation. The primary Judge did not accept the Secretary's argument that the trust was already covered by the ordinary assets test, stating that the trust for Mr Escott is an ""excluded trust"" and therefore not a ""designated private trust"" for the purposes of Pt 3.18.",commonwealth,"Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166","The decisions 14 The Social Security Appeals Tribunal set the Secretary’s decision aside and determined that the monies held by the Public Trustee were not an asset of Mr Escott. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal set that decision aside and substituted a decision that Mr Escott’s beneficial interest in the trust was an asset within the meaning of s 11 and s 198D of the Act but that it was an excluded trust within the meaning of the amended s 198E. As a consequence Ms Geeves was entitled to the carer payment at the time of cancellation. 15 It was argued for the Secretary before his Honour the primary Judge that the trust was already covered by the ordinary assets test. That is to say the funds or property in the trust were Mr Escott’s property and therefore fell within the meaning of the definition of ‘asset’. The exclusion of this type of trust by the declaration meant no more than that the special attribution rules in Part 3.18 do not apply. There was no need for them to apply because Mr Escott’s beneficial interest in the trust was an asset under the ‘ordinary rules’ and in particular the definition in s 11(1) of the Act. His Honour did not accept the submissions, and said (at [18]): ‘What is determinative is not the question of assets in the abstract but how the value of assets is to be “worked out” for the specified purpose of eligibility for carer payments. The clear words of the legislation lead unavoidably to the conclusion that the trust for Mr Escott is an “excluded trust” and therefore not a “designated private trust” for the purposes of Pt 3.18. Thus he is not to be “affected unintentionally” because the Act has made specific provision for what must be a common situation.’"
"In the case of Bhullar v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 1337, what was the reason for Mr Bhullar's incorrect application and how did the court view his position?","In Bhullar v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 1337, Mr Bhullar made an incorrect application due to a reasonable mistake of thinking he could appeal from the Tribunal’s decision. This misunderstanding was based on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) which suggests that such an appeal is available. However, section 483 of the Migration Act 1958 outflanks that provision, indicating that one must apply for constitutional writs where the Tribunal affirms a visa cancellation decision on character grounds. The court regarded Mr Bhullar’s position as being reasonable for a lay person.",commonwealth,Bhullar v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] FCA 1337,"10 Mr Bhullar made the incorrect application within time. But for the Registry’s error he would have made the correct application on Monday 23 August 2010 which was one working day after the 35 day period had expired on Thursday 19 August 2010. The case is one, therefore, where Mr Bhullar made the reasonable mistake of thinking he could appeal from the Tribunal’s decision. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) says that such an appeal is available – s 44 – and it is only with the added knowledge that s 483 of the Migration Act 1958 outflanks that provision that one could know that one must apply for constitutional writs where the Tribunal affirms a visa cancellation decision on character grounds. In those circumstances, I regard Mr Bhullar’s position as being reasonable for a lay person. Generally, however, the merits or otherwise of the underlying application will be relevant to the questions posed on an extension application by s 477A(2)(b). It will be enough for now to note, subject to the question of whether Mr Bhullar’s proposed substantive claim has any merit, that this is otherwise plainly a case for an extension. 11 I turn then to the case Mr Bhullar would advance if an extension of time were to be granted. During the hearing I explained to Mr Bhullar that the relief which this Court was empowered to grant largely related to the legalities of the Tribunal’s processes and not the more basal question of whether his visa should be cancelled. Mr Bhullar made five points during argument. It is useful to deal with them in turn."

This includes an affidavit, part of which I gave him leave to read today, which explains the background to the Supreme Court litigation. It is apparent from the current amended statement of claim in Supreme Court action 6231 of 1999 against the Law Society, Mr McMahon and other officers or former officers of the Law Society that Mr Henderson has a long running complaint now the subject of that litigation against the Law Society and those officers in respect of the administration of certain insurance funds and indemnity funds under the control of the Law Society. 5 These are the only proceedings on foot by Mr Henderson upon which he seeks to rely in answer to both bankruptcy notices. The only relief that Mr Henderson claims in these Supreme Court proceedings is, in effect, the reimbursement of all solicitors (including himself) in his position who, according to the claims he makes in the Supreme Court proceedings, have paid unlawfully exacted and excessive amounts to the Law Society in respect of the various funds administered by the Society. 6 Although Mr McMahon is named as a defendant in the current amended Supreme Court statement of claim, no relief is presently claimed against him by Mr Henderson. Mr Henderson has sought an adjournment and has indicated that one of the things he intends to seek to do during the adjournment is formulate a further amended pleading raising a money claim against Mr McMahon. 7 The Supreme Court proceedings still on foot have reached the stage where the Law Society intends bringing a further strike out application against the current amended statement of claim and orders have apparently been made in the Supreme Court preventing either party taking any further proceeding in the action until the Law Society’s strike-out application has been dealt with, something which will happen in a few weeks time."

She also understood that the procedure involved the application of ""clips"" to her fallopian tubes, but only later came to know about ""Filshie clips"" after reading a newspaper article.",new_south_wales,Cook v Endovasive P/L & Ors [2004] NSWSC 876," 6 Subsequently, the plaintiff consulted Dr Niven at Hawkesbury Hospital. During that consultation Dr Niven advised that the plaintiff should undergo a caesarean section but that it was dangerous to have any more children and recommended that the plaintiff have a sterilisation procedure performed at the time of delivery of her third child. Dr Niven then explained that she would be applying clips to the plaintiff’s fallopian tubes. Dr Niven gave the plaintiff a simple demonstration showing the plaintiff a model of a tube and a clip and informed the plaintiff that the procedure had a one in five hundred risk of failure. 7 During cross-examination the plaintiff gave evidence that when she left Dr Niven’s rooms she understood three things, namely that the sterilisation procedure was her best option, that it was a reversible procedure and that it had a 1 in 500 chance of failure. When the plaintiff was cross-examined about whether Dr Niven referred to the failure of the “Filshie clips” she said that at that time she understood that they were “clips” and that it was later when she read the newspaper article that she came to know about “Filshie clips” (see also para 47 plaintiff’s aff). 8 On 18 July 1994 the plaintiff delivered her third child, a daughter, Sharnee McAlister-Cook at the Hawkesbury Hospital. Dr Niven performed both the caesarean section and the sterilisation procedure. "

It is only that element in the trial Judge’s decision which is, after amendment, the subject of appeal. The appellant contends that the amount awarded for future economic loss is excessive. The respondent, aged twenty-one years, was injured in a motor vehicle accident on 23 March 1992. He suffered a fracture of the right ankle, a sprained 20 left ankle, musculoligamentous injury to his left shoulder, lacerations and bruising. He was hospitalised for three days, but discharged on crutches. He spent a further six months recovering. The trial Judge accepted medical evidence from a Dr Dixon, orthopaedic 25 specialist, and Dr Pillemer, that he had suffered a permanent disability in the right ankle equivalent to about fifteen per cent loss of function. Judge Sinclair found that he was not fit for constant, heavy labouring work on uneven ground; that that unfitness was permanent; that he suffered discomfort in his right leg; and that that discomfort may be exacerbated by work usage. 30 Regarding the sum of $40,000, it is a sum awarded to compensate the respondent for his loss of earning capacity during the remaining forty odd years of his employment.

The Tribunal found that he engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct on each of the bases particularised in respect of Complaint One B, either taken alone or in combination. This was because he contravened a provision of the NSW regulations made under s 247A(2)(d) of the National Law, within the meaning of s 139B(1)(b).",new_south_wales,Health Care Complaints Commissioner v Chamberlain [2017] NSWCATOD 122," 1. the history of Patient A; 2. the results of any physical examination; 3. an assessment of the patient’s mental state; 4. the patient’s use of, and response to, medications; 5. plans for management of the patient; 6. the clinical opinion formed by Dr Chamberlain; 7. the quantity of medications prescribed; or 8. sufficient information to allow for continued management of Patient A by Dr Chamberlain or another practitioner. 39. We have reviewed the relevant handwritten records and a transcript of those records. We accept Dr Nespolon’s opinion that Dr Chamberlain’s conduct in documenting in his medical records his assessment and treatment of Patient A from 2 May 2000 to 11 September 2012 fell significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience and did invite strong criticism for the reasons set out in section 5.14 of his report. 40. In the light of these findings and Dr Chamberlain’s admissions, we are satisfied to the requisite standard that he engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct on each of the bases particularised in respect of Complaint One B, taken alone, and, alternatively, when two or more are taken in combination, because: 1. he contravened a provision of the NSW regulations made under s 247A(2)(d) of the National Law, within the meaning of s 139B(1)(b) (Although the Complaint alleges that the practitioner contravened “a provision of the regulations under the National Law” we do not think there is any unfairness in making the finding we have instead of finding that there had been a contravention of the regulations under the National Law.); and"

The tribunal decided that FFR was not eligible for victims support. This decision was based on the interpretation of the term ""act of violence"" as defined in s 19 of the Act and the definition of ""injury"" in s 18 of the Act, which was found to exclude an injury arising from loss or damage to property. Furthermore, the tribunal found that the evidence did not support a finding that the act of arson was either such as to cause personal intimidation or intended to cause intimidation or submission of FFR.",new_south_wales,FFR v Commissioner of Victims Rights [2022] NSWCATAD 103,"Consideration and Findings 18. The issue for determination is whether by reason of the act of arson that occurred on 25 February 2021, and the injuries arising as a result of that act, make FFR eligible for victims support under Pt 4 of the Act. 19. While not expressly raised by FFR, it is clear that she is asking the Tribunal to adopt a beneficial interpretation of the term “act of violence” as defined in s 19 of the Act. However, the respondent argues that a strict interpretation should be adopted, as a result of which FFR is not eligible for victims support. 20. I note that the leading authority as to how courts and tribunals should approach the issue of statutory interpretation is the decision of the High Court of Australia in Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1988) 194 CLR 255, in which Brennan CJ stated at [69]: The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all provisions of the statute. 21. In applying this principle to the current matter, I am satisfied from the express terms of s 18 of the Act that Parliament intended that the definition of “injury”, for the purposes of ss 19 and 20 of the Act, should exclude an injury arising from loss or damage to property. 22. As to the issue of what constitutes violence, the respondent relies on the decision in R v Butcher (1986) VR 43, which is set out in para 17 above. In applying that decision to this matter, I am satisfied to the required standard that the evidence before me does not support a finding that the act of arson was either such as to cause personal intimidation or intended to cause intimidation or submission of FFR."

"In the case of Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd v Documents on Call Pty Ltd [2018] NSWSC 1862, what was the court's opinion on the operation of the clauses in the contract between the parties?","In the case of Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd v Documents on Call Pty Ltd [2018] NSWSC 1862, the court did not find any basis for diluting or discarding the operation of the clauses in the contract between the parties. The court noted that the parties contracted at arm's length and that the plaintiff, a large commercial entity with considerable commercial experience and influence in the printing industry, should not have the terms of its contracts modified in favour of its customers simply because of its size and reputation. The court also stated that acceptance of the plaintiff's standard terms and conditions did not automatically work any discernible injustice upon the defendants.",new_south_wales,Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd v Documents on Call Pty Ltd [2018] NSWSC 1862,"20. I do not consider in the known circumstances of this case that there is any basis for either diluting or discarding the operation of these clauses. The parties appear to have contracted at arm’s length. I accept that the plaintiff is a large commercial entity with considerable commercial experience and influence in the printing industry. That is not standing alone a reason why the terms of its contracts should be modified in favour of its customers. Indeed, the size and reputation of the plaintiff seem likely to be among some of the advantages the defendants enjoyed in dealing with the plaintiff. Acceptance of its standard terms and conditions does not automatically work any discernible injustice upon the defendants in the context of the geographical inconvenience associated with responding to process issued out of this Court. It is important as well to observe that the laws of this State and the procedures of this Court do not create any difficulties that would not be associated with litigation in Victoria. 21. In my opinion, these clauses are sufficient to dispose of the present application.

"In the case of Gunns Finance Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) v Marks-Isaacs (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 350, what were the two issues with Mr Marks-Isaacs' hardship program application?","In the case of Gunns Finance Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) v Marks-Isaacs (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 350, the court identified two issues with Mr Marks-Isaacs' hardship program application. Firstly, the hardship program was still available after the judgment, and the existence of the judgment did not prevent the alternative form of ex gratia relief from potentially being available to him. Secondly, Mr Marks-Isaacs did not appear to have reasonably pursued his hardship application. His application was cursory, lacking details of his period of unemployment or his income, expenses, assets, etc. When the plaintiff sought his recent past tax returns to assess his financial position, those returns were not provided. As a result, his hardship application was not successful.",new_south_wales,Gunns Finance Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) v Marks-Isaacs (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 350,"THE HARDSHIP PROGRAM 12. The plaintiff did not accept that the hardship program it had instituted was relevant to the setting aside of the judgment. However, Mr Marks‑Isaacs relied upon that program as a factor influencing his conduct and I consider it as relevant on this application. However, there are two matters concerning this hardship program that do not assist Mr Marks‑Isaacs. 13. First, the hardship program might apparently still be available. The evidence discloses that after the judgment, the hardship program was nevertheless pursued by Mr Marks‑Isaacs (although he was, he says, unaware of the judgment) and considered by the plaintiff. It follows that the existence of the judgment does not, or at least did not, prevent that alternative form of ex gratia relief potentially being available to him. 14. Secondly, Mr Marks‑Isaacs does not appear to have reasonably pursued his hardship application. The application that he submitted was of a most cursory nature, referring only to two unattached letters dated two years previously and a ""more recent period of unemployment"". No details of the period of unemployment or of Mr Marks‑Isaacs’ income, expenses, assets and the like were provided, even though it was apparent, on the documents he provided to the Court, that the hardship program, at least in his case, depended on his financial position. When the plaintiff sought from Mr Marks-Isaacs his recent past tax returns to assess his financial position, those returns were not provided. In submissions to the Court Mr Marks‑Isaacs said that those returns remained unavailable as they had not yet been prepared. 15. In these circumstances, it is unsurprising that the hardship application was not successful. There was no evidence that Mr Marks-Isaacs has reapplied. It is thus not a matter that can assist Mr Marks‑Isaacs in this application."

This was a perfectly correct direction of law. On the following page of the record, the judge said that counsel for the plaintiff had said that since the defendant, had called no evidence, the jury could more confidently draw inferences in favour of the plaintiff’s case “because the plaintiff’s case is 35 uncontested”.And the learned judge went on: “That is perhaps not completely so. The plaintiff’s case is not contested by evidence called on behalf of the defendant, but the defendant contests the case by its cross-examination of the plaintiff.” And then Ireland AJ left the essence of the case to the jury in these terms at 40 70: “....

The first was a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirming a decision of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (MRCC) of 2007, which in turn affirmed a decision of Comcare that the applicant was not entitled to compensation for paranoid schizophrenia allegedly caused by his Army service. The second decision was also affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which upheld a decision of the MRCC in 2007 that the applicant was not entitled to compensation for stress-induced paranoid schizophrenia and diabetes, also allegedly caused by his Army service.",commonwealth,Rana v Commonwealth of Australia [2013] FCA 189,"11 The Third HCA Application was accepted for filing on 7 July 2011, but the applicant was told that it would be treated as an application for special leave to appeal from the judgment in Federal Court proceeding No SAD 203 of 2010 (part of the Third FCA Proceeding), and that he should file a separate application, and pay a separate $100.00 filing fee in respect of that judgment in respect of Federal Court proceeding No SAD 202 of 2010, which he also sought to challenge. 12 The Full Court of this Court in the Third FCA Proceeding had heard together and dismissed two applications by way of appeal by the applicant from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal firstly affirming a decision of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (MRCC) of 2007 in turn affirming a decision of Comcare that the applicant was not entitled to compensation for paranoid schizophrenia allegedly caused by his Army service, and secondly affirming a decision of the MRCC also in 2007 that the applicant was not entitled to compensation for stress-induced paranoid schizophrenia and diabetes also allegedly caused by his Army service. The two applications were heard together, but separate orders were made; hence the High Court required two separate applications by the applicant. 13 The applicant then sent a written complaint dated 8 July 2011 to the AHRC alleging that Deputy Registrar Musolino of the High Court “would not process” his application for special leave to appeal from the judgment in Federal Court proceeding No SAD 202 of 2010 (part of the Third HCA Application) and that his human rights were thereby “breached by a federal government agency”."
"In the case of Salar Blanco LLC [2022] NSWSC 1764, what was the concern raised about the proposed scheme for the Delaware merger under Australian law?","In the matter of Salar Blanco LLC [2022] NSWSC 1764, a concern was raised about the proposed scheme for the Delaware merger. The concern was whether the Delaware merger was ""efficacious to transfer all of [Salar Blanco LLC's] property, liabilities and undertaking to [LPI] under Australian law"". It was suggested that a prudent solicitor should consider whether any consent or procedure was available under Australian law to minimise or eliminate any transaction risk. However, it was not clear how the scheme would ensure this consequence, especially in the absence of any apparent operative effect.",new_south_wales,In the matter of Salar Blanco LLC [2022] NSWSC 1764,"15. Mr Oakes also submitted that SB proposed the scheme “to ensure that the assumption by [LPI] of the whole of [SB’s] property, liabilities and undertakings is effective under Australian law”. However, it was not then apparent how the scheme would “ensure” that consequence, absent any apparent operative effect. Mr Oakes pointed to advice given by an experienced American lawyer which recognised the effect of the Delaware merger under Delaware law, but noted a question whether the Delaware merger was “efficacious to transfer all of [SB’s] property, liabilities and undertaking to [LPI] under Australian law” and suggested that a prudent solicitor should consider whether any consent or procedure was available under Australian law to minimise or eliminate any transaction risk. I do not doubt the prudence of addressing that question, but it does not follow that the Court could or should approve a scheme under s 411 of the Act, where it would have no operative effect beyond the steps already taken under the Delaware merger. 16. Mr Oakes recognised that the proposed scheme must involve a “compromise or arrangement” within the meaning of s 411 of the Act, referring to Alstom Signalling Solutions Pty Ltd v Alstom Transport Australia Pty Ltd [2016] FCA 852 at [18]. It was also not apparent how that compromise or arrangement would have been effected by the scheme, in its original form where all relevant steps would have occurred under the Delaware merger prior to implementation of the scheme. Mr Oakes also addressed other aspects of the scheme, but I need not address those submissions further, where the structure of the scheme had changed by the date of the adjourned first Court hearing, so that the relevant transactions would be implemented by the scheme prior to implementation of the Delaware merger."

The plaintiff alleges that that resulted in the second and third defendants causing the company to issue a further 51 shares which are registered in the name of a party related to the second and third defendants. The plaintiff alleges that that conduct has had the effect of diluting his shareholding in the company and that it was not in the company’s best interests. 11 The plaintiff alleges that he has not been paid his annual remuneration in accordance with the Contract or in accordance with an oral variation to the Contract. Paragraph 26B is challenged and it is convenient to set it out in full: 26B Pursuant to the Contract, or, alternatively, by way of oral variation to the Contract, it was agreed by Bandicoot, Vishal, Asheesh and/or Ruchi that Vishal would receive annual remuneration in his role as DSSS of: 26B.1 $110,000 in the financial year ended 30 June 2013; 26B.2 $110,000 in the financial year ended 30 June 2014; 26B.3 $110,000 in the financial year ended 30 June 2015; 26B.4 $121,000 in the financial year ended 30 June 2016.

The court also found that there was no purpose to granting the application for the extension of time, as it was weak on its own facts and there was not an adequate explanation for the fact that the leave application was not filed within time. The court further stated that the real reason the application for an extension of time should be refused was because it would have no utility, given the view that leave to appeal should also be refused.",commonwealth,Quincolli Pty Ltd v Fair Work Ombudsman [2012] FCA 373,"8 In other words, I agree with Rares J’s view that interlocutory appeals of this nature should be discouraged, because in this matter there can be an expeditious and prompt determination of the penalty, and if the applicants are dissatisfied with the result as a whole, then they will have a right to appeal in respect of the whole of the decision. The applicants’ interests, which no doubt are genuine and important to them, in not being subjected to adverse publicity in relation to a penalty hearing cannot outweigh the other interests to which I have referred. For these reasons, it follows that I am of the view that the application for leave to appeal cannot succeed. 9 Consequently, there is no purpose to granting the application for the extension of time. If it be necessary to say so, the application for the extension of time is also weak on its own facts for precisely the reasons set out in the respondent’s written submissions. The applicants were legally represented at the time the judgment was delivered and, possibly more importantly in the circumstances of this case, at the directions hearing on 16 December 2011, when the FMC set the timetable for the hearing on penalty. In those circumstances, there is not an adequate explanation for the fact that the leave application was not filed within time. Be that as it may, however, it seems to me that the real reason the application for an extension of time should be refused in this case is because it would have no utility, given the view that I have that leave to appeal should also be refused. I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jagot."

What were the outcomes of the proceedings in the United States related to the case Allstate Life Insurance Co & Ors v Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd & Ors [1995] FCA 770?,"In the case Allstate Life Insurance Co & Ors v Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd & Ors [1995] FCA 770, it is mentioned that there were two sets of proceedings in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. These proceedings were referred to as ""Linter 1"" and ""Linter 2"". On 1 June 1992, the Linter 1 proceedings were dismissed by the United States Federal District Court. Similarly, on 21 December 1992, the proceedings in Linter 2 were also dismissed by the same Court. The applicants appealed these decisions and on 2 June 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decisions of dismissal in both Linter 1 and Linter 2.

"In the case of Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Lesianawai [2014] FCAFC 141, how did the Tribunal interpret the guidance provided by the Sean Investments passage in relation to the visa cancellation power?","In the case of Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Lesianawai [2014] FCAFC 141, the Tribunal interpreted the guidance provided by the Sean Investments passage as a means to determine how much weight to place on the circumstance that Mr Lesianawai had spent almost all of his formative years in Australia when deciding to exercise the visa cancellation power. The Tribunal reasoned that it was largely for them to determine which matters it regarded as relevant and the comparative importance to be accorded to them.",commonwealth,Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Lesianawai [2014] FCAFC 141,"124 Dealing with ground 1(b) before 1(a), as I read [88], the Tribunal was saying that, in reaching the ultimate decision to exercise the visa cancellation power, the Sean Investments passage provided guidance about how much weight to place on the circumstance that Mr Lesianawai had spent almost all of his formative years in Australia. That interpretation is consistent with the statement that “[t]he power is not fettered by any specific restriction in the Migration Act itself”. Although I acknowledge that this construction is difficult to reconcile with the Tribunal’s previous apparent appreciation of the applicability of Division 55, I agree with the primary judge that the Tribunal explicitly reasoned, at the crucial point of deciding whether to exercise the visa cancellation power, that it was largely for the Tribunal to determine which matters it regarded as relevant and the comparative importance to be accorded to them. 125 Accordingly, I would reject ground 1(b) of the grounds of appeal. 126 This leaves the question raised by ground 1(a). The primary judge found that the Tribunal made a statement that was simply wrong. That was the statement that the visa cancellation power was only the subject of very general guidance in the principles in Direction 55, subclause 6.3(4). The statement was wrong if it was intended to convey that the power is not the subject of very detailed guidance in Direction 55. 127 However, in my view, there is another way of reading this aspect of [88]. In my opinion, what the Tribunal was saying was that the question of how to factor the length of Mr Lesianawai’s Australian residence into the ultimate decision of whether to exercise the visa cancellation power was a question which is only the subject of very general guidance in subclause 6.3(4)."

Here there is but a corporate trustee of a charitable trust. There is no establishment, no organisation and no association. Sargents acts alone exercising the powers conferred upon it by the trust deed. 26 In my judgment, Sargents is not a society or institution and neither the exemption in the Duties Act 1997, s 275(a) nor the exemption in s 271(b) applies to it. Exemption requirements 27 Argument was addressed to the court as to whether or not the Duties Act 1997, s 275(a) or s 275(b) applied to Sargents if it was held to be a society or institution. 28 For example, it was submitted that there was no evidence that the Foundation’s resources were used wholly or predominantly for the relief of poverty in Australia. If they were not, Sargents was not entitled to exemption under the Duties Act 1997, s 275(a). 29 While it was conceded by the Chief Commissioner that the Foundation was of a charitable or benevolent nature for the purposes of the Duties Act 1997, s 275(b), the exemption is not available unless the dutiable transactions were for such purposes as the Chief Commissioner might approve in accordance with guidelines approved by the Treasurer. 30 The Treasurer has promulgated guidelines.

"In the case of Quirk and Miller; In the matter of an urgent application before the start of a proceeding [2014] FCA 1254, what were the two main concerns regarding the potential infringement of Mr Quirk's and Mr Miller's rights to natural justice?","In the case of Quirk and Miller; In the matter of an urgent application before the start of a proceeding [2014] FCA 1254, the two main concerns regarding the potential infringement of Mr Quirk's and Mr Miller's rights to natural justice were: firstly, the real possibility that the Divisional Executive would include persons who might be predisposed against Mr Quirk and Mr Miller or who have been involved in the events which give rise to the charges against them; and secondly, if a hearing was conducted on the same day, they would be denied a reasonable opportunity to consider the charges to be made against them and to prepare their defence.",commonwealth,Quirk and Miller; In the matter of an urgent application before the start of a proceeding [2014] FCA 1254,"5 What appears to be in contemplation is that the CFMEU would be ordered to perform rule 11 of the Rules of the Division in a way which avoided any infringement of the requirements of natural justice. The way in which it is said there is an arguable case that those requirements will be infringed if the meeting goes ahead at 1 pm today is that there is the real possibility that the Divisional Executive will be constituted to include persons who are either the accuser (Mr Noonan) or other persons identified in an affidavit of Mr Les Feher at [14] who are persons who might be predisposed against Mr Quirk and Mr Miller or who have been involved in the events which give rise to the charges against them. Those persons are identified as Rita Mallia, Brian Parker and Frank O’Grady. 6 The second respect in which it has been suggested that Mr Quirk’s and Mr Miller’s rights to natural justice might be infringed is that if a hearing was conducted today they would be denied a reasonable opportunity to consider the charges to be made against them and to prepare their defence. 7 It is possible that proceedings may also be commenced against the CFMEU as the employer of Mr Quirk and Mr Miller under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (“the Fair Work Act”). Mr Feher’s affidavit refers to certain respects in which it might, in due course, be contended that the provisions of the Fair Work Act might be infringed. However, at this point in time that is only a possibility and it was candidly conceded by Mr Neil of senior counsel that the prospects for the employment of Mr Quirk and Mr Miller are unknown, although on his submission the prospect that they will be removed as divisional officers of the CFMEU has been established to the necessary standard."

The “terminated complaint” to which the section refers is the complaint in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the termination of which gave rise to the court's jurisdiction. In this case, none of the parties proposed to be added was a respondent to the applicant's complaint in the commission. Therefore, none could have been joined as a respondent to these proceedings, and none can now be joined upon the basis that they ought to have been joined originally under para (b) of r 8(1) of O 6 of the Rules of Court.",commonwealth,O'Donoghue v State of Western Australia [2013] FCA 903," Under s 46PO of the HREOC Act, an application to the court may be made only in relation to “unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint”.

In the circumstances, none could have been joined as a respondent to these proceedings, and none can now be joined upon the basis that they ought to have been joined originally under para (b) of r 8(1) of O 6 of the Rules of Court. 24 The Commonwealth observes that although in Bahonko Jessup J held that the Minister could not have been made a respondent in the first instance because she was not a party to the terminated complaint, his Honour stated that he accepted that this consideration may not always be dispositive in an application under O 6 r 8(1)(b) of the former Federal Court Rules (at [46]). Nevertheless, his Honour went on to state (at [46]) that it would, in his view: … be a most unusual case in which the court took the view that it was necessary to join a new party as a respondent in order to determine, effectively and completely, the matters in dispute when no relief could have been, or could now be, sought against that party. In my view the present is a long way from being such an unusual case. (emphasis added)"
"In the case of Court v University of Western Sydney [2013] NSWADT 16, what disability does Ms Court have?","In the case of Court v University of Western Sydney [2013] NSWADT 16, it is accepted by the University that Ms Court has a hearing impairment.",new_south_wales,Court v University of Western Sydney [2013] NSWADT 16," As a result of constant harassment (by the University) I eventually subjected myself to 12 hours of investigations demanded by UWS at Wollongong University, Neuropsych Department and I discovered that I am missing a step in the learning process in my brain. Whilst I would love to expand on this, I am currently in the middle of extensive tests which will continue between now and January. Its not a secret what is wrong, it is simply very rare and if I am going to waste a specialist's time and money attending the tribunal I want him to be the right specialist. For now it is enough that Dr's have written and provided UWS with the reports they requested at the time they requested them. I am deliberately restricting this complaint to the time frame that I made the complaint and not allowing UWS to have random access to anything they want. What has been provided in the past is sufficient for this matter to proceed. Once enrolled under disability services, it follows that disability legislation applies. 31The University accepts that Ms Court has a hearing impairment."
"In the context of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, how are the terms ""urban"" and ""primarily"" interpreted in the State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP)?","In the case of Club Marconi Limited v Fairfield City Council [2021] NSWLEC 132, the court interpreted the terms ""urban"" and ""primarily"" in the context of the State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP) under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. The term ""urban"" was construed to mean pertaining to or constituting a city or a town. The term ""primarily"" was interpreted to mean chiefly or principally. The court also noted that when considering the concept of ""town"" and ""city"", it is necessary to consider population density as the purpose to be served is one connected with a population base.",new_south_wales,Club Marconi Limited v Fairfield City Council [2021] NSWLEC 132," Where a beneficial statute is expressed in general terms, so far as possible within the text, decision-makers will construe the legislation to advance and achieve those beneficial purposes - not to frustrate and defeat their attainment: Marks v GIO Australia Holdings at [124] per Kirby J; Boral Besser Masonry per Kirby J at [384]. This approach is reinforced in this case by the requirements of s 25 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act to which I have earlier referred. 35. The beneficial nature of the SEPP is expressed in its Aims as outlined at [12] above. 36. As both parties accept, applying such a beneficial construction to the ordinary meaning of the word use in cl 4 of the SEPP: 1. “Urban” means pertaining to or constituting a city or a town; and 2. “Primarily” means chiefly or principally. 37. It is necessary, when having regard to the concept of “town” and “city”, to consider population density as the purpose to be served is one connected with a population base. If there is no relevant density of population the purpose could not relate to a town or city. Whilst I accept that the nature or identity of the persons that may resort to a permitted use is not a relevant consideration the broader consideration of the purpose being served by the permitted use in the context requires a consideration of whether the permitted uses are ones that relate to serving a density of population that could enable the use to be characterised as primarily for urban purposes."
"In the case of Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 862, what was Mr Sexton's argument regarding the vicarious liability and the role of Mr Paseka in relation to the sale of liquor?","In the case of Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 862, Mr Sexton argued that the need to consider the matters that section 64 emphasises overrides any error in his previous statement. He believed that the case was not untenable and the need for a special relationship as the touchstone for the existence of vicarious liability was not yet settled. He further argued that the existence of some necessary relationship of employment or other agency or agreement was in this case established by or derived from the sale of liquor. According to him, Mr Paseka was someone engaged by or on behalf of Mr Keough in his capacity as the licensee of the Bridge Hotel to ensure that he did not permit intoxication, or any indecent, violent or quarrelsome conduct, on his licensed premises contrary to section 125(1)(b) of the Liquor Act. He also argued that the actions of Mr Paseka beyond the boundaries of the licensed premises of the Bridge Hotel did not prevent the actions of Mr Paseka falling within the terms of section 125(1)(b), to the extent that the assault was relevantly capable of being considered, in the context of an action taken for the benefit of the licensee for the purposes of the section, wherever it may physically have occurred or taken place.",new_south_wales,Orcher v Bowcliff Pty Ltd (No 4) [2011] NSWSC 862,"20Mr Sexton's response to these matters was to concede that his statement to me on 7 October 2010 was erroneous and to propound the proposition that the need to consider the matters that s 64 emphasises overrides anything arising from that error. The discretion that I am required to exercise was in his view unaffected by the change of position that he now wished to adopt. The case was not untenable. The need for a special relationship as the touchstone for the existence of vicarious liability was in his submission not yet settled. In any event, the existence of some necessary relationship of employment or other agency or agreement that Mr Sheldon emphasised was in this case established by or derived from the sale of liquor. Having regard to the definition of a ""person authorised to sell liquor"" within the meaning of that expression in s 4 of the Liquor Act and its relationship to or interaction with s 125 of the Act, Mr Paseka was someone engaged by or on behalf of Mr Keough in his capacity as the licensee of the Bridge Hotel to ensure that he did not, as such a licensee, ""permit intoxication, or any indecent, violent or quarrelsome conduct, on his...licensed premises"" contrary to s 125(1)(b) of the Act. The actions of Mr Paseka beyond the boundaries of the licensed premises of the Bridge Hotel did not, on Mr Sexton's analysis, prevent the actions of Mr Paseka falling within the terms of s 125(1)(b), to the extent that the assault was relevantly capable of being considered, in the context of an action taken for the benefit of the licensee for the purposes of the section, wherever it may physically have occurred or taken place."
"In the case of Wright v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited [2002] NSWSC 165, what was the plaintiff's motion and how did the court respond to it?","In the case of Wright v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited [2002] NSWSC 165, the plaintiff sought leave to file an amended statement of claim, maintaining the allegation that the driver was Anthony Thompson but adding alternative allegations that it was Brian Thompson or a person unknown. The court did not refuse the application on the grounds that the plaintiff had had his opportunity to file a statement of claim in accordance with the leave which had been granted and had made an informed decision to proceed as he did. The court viewed the application as an amendment under Pt 20 of the rules, not as an addition of a new party.",new_south_wales,Wright v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited [2002] NSWSC 165," 4 Before me is a motion by the plaintiff seeking leave to file an amended statement of claim, which maintains the allegation that the driver was Anthony Thompson but adds alternative allegations that it was Brian Thompson or a person unknown. However, at the hearing the amendment relating to Brian Thompson was not pressed and argument was confined to the allegation of an unidentified driver. That amendment is opposed. 5 Counsel for the defendant insurer submitted that, as a matter of discretion, I should refuse the amendment because the plaintiff had had his opportunity to file a statement of claim in accordance with the leave which had been granted and had made an informed decision to proceed as he did. However, as I have said, I do not believe that the form of the statement of claim was the result of an informed decision and I would not refuse the application for that reason. 6 Counsel for the defendant also argued that the plaintiff seeks effectively to add a new party, so that this amounts to a further application under s 52(4) of the Motor Accidents Act when the time limitation prescribed by that act has long since expired. He referred, by way of analogy, to Fernance v Nominal Defendant (1989) 17 NSWLR 710. Even if the present application were to be characterised in that way, it would clearly have merit. However, that is not how I view it and I am satisfied that it is an application for amendment under Pt 20 of the rules. The insurer is named as the defendant in the statement of claim because, at the time it was filed, Anthony Thompson could not be located: s 54 of the Motor Accidents Act. By the same provision, inability to identify the driver also enables the insurer to be named as defendant. No question of the addition of a party arises. "

Mr F's actions as a participant in the guerrilla movement against the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, and through returning to East Timor after independence, indicate he was prepared to live the remainder of his life in his home country.

The Tribunal intended to hear witnesses orally in its hearing room in Sydney and also link up by telephone with witnesses located in Timor-Leste (various family members and the doctor intended to manage Mr F's care needs there). 6On the morning of Monday 8 July Mr F died in hospital in Sydney. 7The review applicant, AQN, and Mr Dalla-Pozza for the Public Guardian have attended the Tribunal today. 8AQN accepts that in the circumstances it is better not to continue to pursue her objection to the decision.

"What is the calculus of risk approach in the context of New South Wales legal decisions, and how does it apply when the nature of the harm is severe?","In the context of New South Wales legal decisions, such as in the case of NSW Police Force v Alameddine (No. 2) [2023] NSWSC 633, the calculus of risk approach requires the court to consider the nature, imminence and degree of likelihood of harm occurring to the relevant person. If the prospective harm is very severe, such as death, it may be more readily concluded that an order is necessary even if the risk does not rise beyond a mere possibility. Under this approach, the nature of the harm carries weight in the calculus of risk, meaning that it would not be necessary for the court to be satisfied that it was probable that the threats would be carried out. The fact that the possible harm was so serious would lead to the court’s being satisfied under s 8(1)(c) that an order was necessary in circumstances where it could not be said to be probable that the threats would be carried out.",new_south_wales,NSW Police Force v Alameddine (No. 2) [2023] NSWSC 633," The calculus of risk approach requires the court to consider the nature, imminence and degree of likelihood of harm occurring to the relevant person. If the prospective harm is very severe, it may be more readily concluded that the order is necessary even if the risk does not rise beyond a mere possibility. … Under the calculus of risk approach the nature of the harm (death) would carry weight in the calculus of risk which would have the effect that it would not be necessary for the court to be satisfied that it was probable that the threats would be carried out.

A further order modifying or discharging the interlocutory order or injunction will be appropriate whenever new facts come into existence or are discovered which render its enforcement unjust.

The first advertisement, running from December 2009 to September 2010, was headed “Organic Fertilizer” followed by smaller text reading “Guano Gold organic 100% natural phosphate fertiliser. Available in store Melb, in bulk, 1 tonne bags or 25 kg bags [telephone numbers]”. The second advertisement, running from September 2010 to July 2011, was headed “Fertilizer Organic” with the words “Guano Gold” in the second line. The advertisements ceased to refer to Guano Gold from 3 August 2011. The words “Kwik Start” did not appear in the advertisements. 9 It must be noted that the advertisements were neither large nor prominently positioned. They only ran weekly in the classified section of one rural newspaper. The two advertisements are set out below in the size that they appeared in the newspaper. 10 After July 2011 the advertisements no longer included the words Guano Gold, and instead just referred to guano.

Jarvis’ affidavit asserts that McCready referred again, at the Council meeting on 15 November 2000, to his questions at the 1 November meeting (Exhibit A5 p 17 and Exhibit A7 pp1-2, cf Exhibit A1 fol 2.199). She says that the Mayor “refused to allow the question and described it as unintelligent” (par 43 of her affidavit). (See Exhibit A1 fol 2.215-216 for reference to a transcript of this incident and its aftermath). The transcript of that meeting (Exhibit A7) clearly records McCready quoting from the letter of 1 November 2000 and saying that he got it from “the person who received” it. 23. Murphy’s position was, and remains, that the matter he was to investigate was not “the Centrelink issue”, but the allegation that Mrs Hardgrave was the author of the “handwritten note”. He gave evidence that he has had no involvement with “the Centrelink issue”. 24. Following the incident with McCready on 15 November 2000, Murphy lodged with Percy a complaint regarding Jarvis (Annexure ‘J’, dated 23 November 2000, to Murphy’s affidavit of 16 May 2001).

"Under the Guardianship Act 1987 in New South Wales, is it required for the Tribunal to take into account the views of the persons involved when exercising any function under the Act?","Yes, under s 4(d) of the Guardianship Act 1987 in New South Wales, when exercising any function under the Act, the Tribunal must observe the principle that ""the views of such persons in relation to the exercise of those functions should be taken into consideration."" This was highlighted in the case of QJ v Public Guardian & Ors [2005] NSWADTAP 45.",new_south_wales,QJ v Public Guardian & Ors [2005] NSWADTAP 45," 22 The final ground of appeal was that the Tribunal did not take into account QM’s views in reaching its decision. Mr Hozack told the Tribunal that QM was ill and was unable to attend the hearing. It is apparent from the report from the Tribunal’s investigation officer that her views were not obtained prior to the hearing. Under s 4(d) of the Guardianship Act 1987, when exercising any function under the Act, the Tribunal must observe the principle that “the views of such persons in relation to the exercise of those functions should be taken into consideration.” It is implicit in the Tribunal’s reasons for decision that the Guardianship Tribunal did not regard QM as able to present any reliable evidence of her views. Although it would have been preferable for the Tribunal to make some reference to QM’s views during the course of its reasons, for the reasons set out in LA v Protective Commissioner & Ors [2004] NSWADTAP 39, we do not consider that the Tribunal’s failure to do so constitutes an error of law. Conclusion 23 We have decided to set aside each of the Guardianship Tribunal’s decisions and remit those matters back to the Tribunal to decide again. The reason for that decision is the availability of new evidence which is significantly different from the evidence the Tribunal relied on in coming to its decision. Orders 1. The Guardianship Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the application for a guardianship order is set aside. 2. The Guardianship Tribunal’s decision to dismiss the application for a financial management order is set aside. "

"In the case of Building Partners Pty Ltd v AEA Constructions Pty Ltd [2018] NSWSC 1033, what was the court's view on the defendant's refusal to accept the plaintiff's offer of indemnity?","In Building Partners Pty Ltd v AEA Constructions Pty Ltd [2018] NSWSC 1033, the court considered it unreasonable for the defendant not to have accepted the plaintiff's offer of indemnity. The plaintiff's offer, made on 23 December 2016, involved a compromise where the interest, which had accrued to approximately $40,000 by that date, would be waived. The court found the case for liability in negligence of the defendant to Mr Wharekawa very strong and readily proved.",new_south_wales,Building Partners Pty Ltd v AEA Constructions Pty Ltd [2018] NSWSC 1033,"5. With respect to the plaintiff’s claim for indemnity, its offer of 23 December 2016 involved an element of compromise in that interest, which had accrued to approximately $40,000 by that date, would be waived. I consider it was unreasonable for the defendant not to have accepted this. The case for liability in negligence of the defendant to Mr Wharekawa was, in my view, very strong and I readily found it proved for the reasons given at [21]-[53] of the principal judgment. Having regard to the medical evidence which had been served on the defendant by late December 2016 it was clear that if Mr Wharekawa did establish his case on liability his damages would likely well exceed the figure of slightly under $300,000 for which the plaintiff sought indemnity under s 151Z."
"In the case of McGrath v Mestousis [2017] NSWSC 995, what was the court's decision regarding the use of 32 Darwin having the benefit of the easement in relation to public interest?","In McGrath v Mestousis [2017] NSWSC 995, the court was satisfied that the use of 32 Darwin having the benefit of the easement was not inconsistent with the public interest. The court noted that the easement was part of a common type of development in many areas of Sydney and there was no evidence to suggest that the development, including the use of the easement, would be contrary to the public interest. On the contrary, the development and use were in accordance with the Council consent given on 11 May 2017. The court assumed that the consent was given after consideration by the Council of the matters required to be taken into account under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW). The evidence of Mr Kenny concerning the merits of various alternative routes for an easement further supported this conclusion.",new_south_wales,McGrath v Mestousis [2017] NSWSC 995,"77. As to s 88K(2)(a), I am satisfied that use of 32 Darwin having the benefit of the easement will not be inconsistent with the public interest. As noted earlier, Mr Gruzman did not specifically address this question. In any case, the easement forms part of a development of a type which is common throughout many areas of Sydney. There is nothing to suggest that the development, including the use of the easement, would be contrary to the public interest. On the contrary, such development and use would be in accordance with the Council consent given on 11 May 2017. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that the consent was given after consideration by the Council of the matters required to be taken into account under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW). Even if not itself decisive, that fact is highly material (see Shi v ABI-K Pty Ltd (supra) at [70]). The evidence of Mr Kenny concerning the merits of various alternative routes for an easement further supports the conclusion that the use of 32 Darwin having the benefit of the easement is not inconsistent with the public interest."

Indeed, in the first stage of the process, the Court may need to arrive at an assessment of what is the proper level of maintenance and what is adequate provision, in which event, if it becomes necessary to embark upon the second stage of the process, that assessment will largely determine the order which should be made in favour of the applicant. In saying that, we are mindful that there may be some circumstances in which a court could refuse to make an order notwithstanding that the applicant is found to have been left without adequate provision for proper maintenance. Take, for example, a case like Ellis v Leeder where there were no assets from which an order could reasonably be made and making an order could disturb the testator's arrangements to pay creditors."" 11 As directed by the High Court, I turn to look at the present situation of the plaintiff.

What are the principles governing the grant of leave in New South Wales as identified in Be Financial Pty Ltd as Trustee for Be Financial Operations Trust v Das [2012] NSWCA 164?,"In the case of Passion Projects (ALLYOUNEEDISLOVE) Pty Ltd v Concept Moulding Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 415, the principles governing the grant of leave as identified in Be Financial Pty Ltd as Trustee for Be Financial Operations Trust v Das [2012] NSWCA 164 were referenced. These principles include: (a) The applicant for leave must demonstrate something more than that the trial judge was arguably wrong. (b) It is important that there be early finality in cases where the costs involved are likely to swamp the money sum involved in the dispute. (c) Ordinarily it will be appropriate to grant leave only in matters that involve issues of principle, questions of general public importance or an injustice which is reasonably clear in the sense of going beyond what is merely arguable. (d) Regard is to be had, by reason of s 58 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), to ""the degree of injustice that would be suffered by the respective parties as a consequence"", and, by reason of s 60, to the obligation upon a court to implement its practice and procedure with the object of resolving the issues in such a way that the costs to the parties is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the subject matter in dispute.",new_south_wales,Passion Projects (ALLYOUNEEDISLOVE) Pty Ltd v Concept Moulding Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 415,"4Secondly, leave is required by reason of the fact that the statutory demand (as varied) is in an amount considerably less than the $100,000 threshold set by s 101(2)(r), or, alternatively, as Mr Bogan who appeared for the applicant contended, because the judgment was interlocutory. 5It is not necessary for the purposes of this application to express a view as to which of those provisions requiring the further grant of leave is applicable.

"In the case of Todd v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1276, what was the change in diagnosis made by Dr. Stephenson?","In the case of Todd v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1276, Dr. Stephenson initially diagnosed the patient with a generalised anxiety disorder. However, she later amended her diagnosis to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, presenting primarily with symptoms of Generalised and Phobic Anxiety and of Chronic Dysphoria, which may intensify at times to Major Depressive Illness.",commonwealth,Todd v Repatriation Commission [2008] FCA 1276," 29 It appears that at some time shortly after the receipt of this report, an officer within the Department of Veterans’ Affairs discussed a diagnosis with a Dr Mackay. That appears from an annotation on the copy of Dr Stephenson’s report and there is a further annotation, “Generalised anxiety disorder”. 30 The submission which was developed by reference to this was that the Tribunal ought, notwithstanding the course proceedings took before it, to have considered the question of whether the claimed anxiety disorder was a condition in respect of which an hypothesis could be developed connecting it with circumstances of either eligible defence service or operational service. A difficulty though with that, quite apart from any question of the absence of anything having been made of this before the Tribunal, is that Dr Stephenson seems later to have changed her opinion as to what was the nature of the condition which she described in that general way in 1998. 31 The material before the Tribunal included a further report from Dr Stephenson, dated 22 November 1999. That report appears to have been prepared by her in conjunction with her completion of a medical impairment worksheet for the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. It is true, as was submitted on behalf of Mr Todd, that in the worksheet itself in the block directed to psychiatric condition, the annotation, “PTSD oblique generalised anxiety (also panic disorder)”, appears. One must, though, read that in conjunction with the report of 22 November 1999. In that, Dr Stephenson states: In summary, I am happy to amend my diagnosis to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, presenting primarily with symptoms of Generalised and Phobic Anxiety and of Chronic Dysphoria, which may well intensify at times to Major Depressive Illness."
"Under the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW), what factors must the Drug Court consider when reconsidering a drug offender's initial sentence upon termination of their program?","Under the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW), when terminating a drug offender's program, the Drug Court must reconsider the drug offender's initial sentence. In reconsidering the initial sentence, the Drug Court must take into consideration the nature of the drug offender's participation in his or her program, any sanctions that have been imposed on the drug offender during the program, and any time for which the drug offender has been held in custody in connection with an offence to which his or her program relates. This includes time during which the person has undergone imprisonment under the sentence or under the condition of the program arising under section 8A.",new_south_wales,Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW),"12 Imposition of final sentence (1) On terminating a drug offender’s program, the Drug Court must reconsider the drug offender’s initial sentence. (2) In reconsidering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court must take into consideration— (a) the nature of the drug offender’s participation in his or her program, and (b) any sanctions that have been imposed on the drug offender during the program, and (c) any time for which the drug offender has been held in custody in connection with an offence to which his or her program relates, including time during which the person has undergone imprisonment— (i) under the sentence, or (ii) under the condition of the program arising under section 8A. (3) After considering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court is to determine the drug offender’s final sentence— (a) by making an order setting aside the initial sentence and taking such action under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it could have taken for the offence to which the initial sentence related, or (b) by making an order confirming the initial sentence. (4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence. (5) For the purpose of making an order under subsection (3) in relation to an initial sentence imposed before the commencement of this subsection, subsections (3) and (4) have effect as if the amendments made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Sentencing Options) Act 2017 were in force when the initial sentence was imposed."

"In the case of Dowsett v King (No 2) [2020] NSWSC 6, what was the nature of Mrs Dowsett's claim and how did it relate to the court's jurisdiction?","In the case of Dowsett v King (No 2) [2020] NSWSC 6, Mrs Dowsett's claim was for a sum of $140,000 plus interest, which she argued was owed to her as a result of a breach of trust. However, the pleadings did not seek a declaration that a trust existed over that sum, but rather that Donna ""pay"" the sum to Mrs Dowsett. This suggested that Mrs Dowsett's monetary entitlement arose as a consequence of a breach of trust, which could be described as equitable compensation. According to the District Court Act, a claim for equitable compensation arising from a breach of trust falls within s 134(1)(e). However, because the proposed equitable claim in this case exceeded the $20,000 limit in that section, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to determine that claim as it was precluded from falling within the residual equitable jurisdiction in s 134(1)(h) of the Act.",new_south_wales,Dowsett v King (No 2) [2020] NSWSC 6,"19. The sub-sections above that are relevant to the present case are paragraphs (e) and (h). It is clear from a reading of s 134 as a whole that an equitable claim falling within one or more of the paragraphs contained in s 134(1)(a)–(g) (which are mostly limited to equitable claims up to the value of $20,000) will be excluded from the court’s residual equitable jurisdiction set out in s 134(1)(h) (which is limited only by the court’s general jurisdictional limit, that is, $750,000). 20. By her pleadings, there was a degree of imprecision in terms of the relief available as a consequence of establishing Mrs Dowsett’s entitlement to a trust over the $140,000 sum. Mrs Dowsett did not seek a declaration that a trust existed over that sum, with consequential orders for that sum to be returned to Mrs Dowsett. Rather, the pleadings simply claimed that Donna “pay” $140,000 plus interest to Mrs Dowsett. Relief of this kind suggests that Mrs Dowsett’s monetary entitlement arose as a consequence of a breach of trust by Donna such that the claim might be described as equitable compensation. 21. In McDonough v Owners Strata Plan No 57504 (2014) 17 BPR 33,573; [2014] NSWSC 1708, Brereton J (as his Honour then was) held that a claim for equitable compensation arising from a breach of trust fell within s 134(1)(e) of the District Court Act. Because the proposed equitable claim in that case exceeded the $20,000 limit in that section, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to determine that claim as it was precluded from falling within the residual equitable jurisdiction in s 134(1)(h) of the Act."

"In the context of multiple related cases, what are the three main possibilities for how the hearings could be conducted according to the decision in Lin v One Funds Management Limited [2021] NSWSC 1450?","In the decision of Lin v One Funds Management Limited [2021] NSWSC 1450, it was noted that there are three main possibilities for how hearings could be conducted if the cases are in the same list. The first possibility is that the cases are heard consecutively. The second possibility is that they are heard together. The third possibility is that they are heard together and an order is made that evidence in one is to be evidence in the other. The order that is ultimately made is likely to depend on the issues in each case as finally disclosed by the evidence.",new_south_wales,Lin v One Funds Management Limited [2021] NSWSC 1450,"19. There appear to be three main possibilities in relation to the hearings if the cases are in the same list. The first is that the cases are heard consecutively. The second is that they are heard together. The third is that they are heard together and an order is made that evidence in one is to be evidence in the other. As I have said, which order is ultimately made is likely to depend on the issues in each case as finally disclosed by the evidence. From the defendants’ point of view, there is unlikely to be a great deal of difference between consecutive hearings before the same judge in Melbourne and a hearing of the Chen Proceeding in Melbourne and this proceeding in Sydney. It is true that if the cases are heard consecutively, those on the defendants’ side will only need to set aside one block of time, instead of two. But the total length of the two hearings is unlikely to be substantially different. On any view, the Directors will only be required to travel to Melbourne once. The position may be improved from the defendants’ point of view if the two proceedings are heard together. But that is likely to be at the expense of Ms Lin. Inevitably, if the two cases are heard together, Ms Lin’s lawyers will be affected because they will not be involved in a single continuous hearing. That is likely to add to Ms Lin’s costs of the case, particularly if an order is made that evidence in one case is to be evidence in the other. The position may be ameliorated if the Court makes an order of the type suggested by the defendants’ solicitor. However, Ms Lin’s lawyers will still need to make an assessment of the evidence filed in the Chen Proceeding to determine whether any of it is relevant to her case. If they conclude that it is, they may wish to make an application to cross-examine the person giving that evidence."
"In the case of NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (2000) 107 FCR 270, did the court consider the advisers who were recommending Citibank's product as part of a negative gearing package to be agents of Citibank?","In NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (2000) 107 FCR 270, the court decided that the advisers recommending Citibank's product as part of a negative gearing package were not considered agents of Citibank. The court found that the supply of Citibank forms and the advisers' roles in relation to the completion, signing and forwarding to Citibank of them did not, per se, characterise the advisers as agents of Citibank. Furthermore, although one adviser, K, had an agency agreement with Citibank, the scope of statements that K was authorised by Citibank to make was very small and the statements made by K were outside those that Citibank authorised him to make.",commonwealth,Technology Leasing Ltd v Lennmar Pty Ltd [2012] FCA 709,"162 Branwhite was subsequently considered by Lindgren J in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (2000) 107 FCR 270 (‘NMFM’). In NMFM, a negative gearing financial strategy was offered to individual investors whereby investors would mortgage their homes to Citibank and then use the loan received to invest in a property trust. K was a financial adviser who received commissions from Citibank and NMFM from referring customers to their products. K made misrepresentations to customers in relation to NMFM’s package. K also failed to warn investors of the dangers involved in such a product. K and the other advisors had Citibank mortgage application forms, which they or their customers filled out and which the customers signed. Citibank knew that the advisers had these forms and that they were recommending their product as part of the negative gearing package, but Citibank did not know all of the details of the package. The question for the Court was whether the advisers were the agents of Citibank. 163 Lindgren J followed Branwhite and decided at [562] that the supply of Citibank forms and the advisers’ roles in relation to the completion, signing and forwarding to Citibank of them did not, per se, characterise the advisers as agents of Citibank. By merely providing the forms, Citibank did not put the advisers in a position to make the misrepresentations: see NMFM at [567]. Furthermore, although K had an agency agreement with Citibank, the scope of statements that K was authorised by Citibank to make was very small: see NMFM at [760]. The statements made by K were outside those that Citibank authorised him to make."

My friend certainly inappropriately [sic?] does rely on the fact that it’s only just over the large commercial quantity in terms of quantum and this is certainly a factor which would reduce the objective seriousness from the mid range, but it is certainly not a matter that your Honour should give undue weight to. …when you’re considering the level of objective seriousness, in the Crown’s submission it would be getting close to middle of the range for seriousness. I’m not suggesting it is middle of the range, but it certainly isn’t bottom of the range…” 18 Her Honour did not, in the course of the sentencing hearing, expressly or implicitly, accept that submission. 19 In GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198 the High Court held (at [30]-[31]): “…it is for the sentencing judge, alone, to decide the sentence to be imposed.

The appellant's position was that communication with the husband was not a separate service but a part of the service being provided to the appellant. This proposition was considered plainly arguable.

Absent the opportunity to file any pleading to identify all of the material facts on which the appellant relied (an opportunity the primary judge denied the appellant, as discussed below), the application as filed was manifestly sufficient to raise an arguable case that the services in question included services by way of information to the husband so that he could support the appellant during the birth, confer with her as necessary, participate in the making of decisions about the treatment of the appellant and their child and, if necessary, give consent to treatment and procedures if the appellant was unable to do so. As the appellant’s written submissions put it, communication with the husband was not a separate service but a part of the service being provided to the appellant. This proposition is plainly arguable. Further, and as the appellant’s submissions also said, even if the service was being provided only to the appellant, it was equally plainly arguable that the associate provision (s 7 of the DD Act) was engaged and that the appellant was treated less favourably than a person whose associate did not have the disability in the same circumstances."

Tudor Capital primarily relied on the expert evidence of Professor Anne Keogh and Dr Stephen Rainer to this effect. They, in turn, primarily based their opinions on autopsy slides of tissue samples taken from Mr Christensen’s heart on autopsy. The slides were not the subject of evidence until after most of the expert reports were prepared, and until after Associate Professor Richards gave oral evidence. However, prior to giving evidence, and before Professor Keogh and Dr Rainer were called, Associate Professor Richards had seen a report from Dr Rainer discussing the slides. Associate Professor Richards had advised Mrs Christensen’s solicitors he was not qualified to analyse the autopsy slides."

"In the case of Higginson -v- Cargill Australia Limited [2001] NSWADT 152, what two elements must be established to succeed in a complaint of direct discrimination?","In the case of Higginson -v- Cargill Australia Limited [2001] NSWADT 152, to succeed in a complaint of direct discrimination, the complainant must first establish that the respondent subjected him to different treatment. Second, the complainant must prove that the respondent did so on the grounds of his disability.",new_south_wales,Higginson -v- Cargill Australia Limited [2001] NSWADT 152," 41 In Commissioner of Corrective Services -v- Aldridge [2000] NSWADTAP 5 an Appeal Panel of the Tribunal, after considering the leading authorities, posed a question to be asked in cases of direct discrimination: Did the respondent on the ground of the complainant’s disability treat the complainant less favourably than it treated or would have treated a person without that disability in the same circumstances or circumstances that were not materially different? This test involves two elements labelled by the Appeal Panel in Aldridge as “different treatment” and “causation”. 42 Therefore to succeed in his complaint of direct discrimination Mr Higginson must first establish that the respondent, in refusing to allow him to return to work, subjected him to different treatment; and second, that the respondent did so on the grounds of his disability. 43 It is not in issue that the respondent’s refusal to allow Mr Higginson to return to work throughout the relevant period constitutes different treatment than that meted out to Mr Higginson’s work colleagues. The respondent’s maintenance fitters who did not suffer from Mr Higginson’s particular disability (and there is no evidence of any who did) were not refused employment throughout the relevant period (August 1998-May 1999). What is in issue is whether this treatment also constitutes less favourable treatment. Can it be said that the necessary element of detriment, central to the concept of “less favourable treatment” has been made out? The task falls to the complainant to prove on balance that the evidence objectively assessed establishes that his treatment was less favourable. "
"In the case of Watton v MacTaggart [2020] NSWSC 1233, how did the court view Jannette's belief of being sexually abused by the deceased in relation to her financial needs?","In Watton v MacTaggart [2020] NSWSC 1233, the court found Jannette's belief that she was sexually abused by the deceased to be relevant to her financial needs. This belief was not seen as a recent invention and it explained her lack of contact with the deceased after her mother's death. The court noted that this belief may have caused Jannette a measure of psychological harm which has increased her financial needs in regards to her health. However, the court did not suggest that any order for further provision is, or should be seen as, reparation or compensation for any such conduct in the past. Rather, it is an order that follows the evaluative process set out in the Succession Act.",new_south_wales,Watton v MacTaggart [2020] NSWSC 1233,"240. I endorse his Honour’s approach in that regard (see also the similar approach taken by McLaughlin AsJ in Evans v Levy [2010] NSWSC 504 at [47]). In the present proceedings, Jannette’s belief that she was sexually abused by the deceased is relevant insofar that this is not a recent invention; and it certainly explains what might otherwise have been a discounting factor (namely, her lack of contact with the deceased after her mother’s death). It is telling, in my opinion, that the level of family contact by Jannette seems to have largely come to an end when her mother died, which would be consistent with her wishing before then to maintain a relationship with her mother even though that involved a level of contact with her father. It is also relevant insofar as it may have caused Jannette a measure of psychological harm which has increased her financial needs in regards to her health albeit that the evidence suggests it may be only one of a number of factors and it is not possible to make any finding as to the overall causal effect of any such conduct as may (or may not) have occurred or by reference to what I accept is Jannette’s genuine belief that such conduct occurred. In saying this, I certainly do not suggest that any order for further provision is, or should be seen as, reparation or compensation for any such conduct in the past. It is not. Rather, it is an order that follows the evaluative process set out in the Succession Act, having regard to the factors that I have discussed above."

However, with respect, it is impossible to accept that submission, because if no monies were lent under a mortgage in this form, there is no security anyhow, and secondly, it is impossible on that basis to see why a cash payment of $1.216 million would be made to Finance as mortgagee. 45 Then as I have indicated earlier, by letter of 28 March 2002 Mr Carey sent to the plaintiff his calculations as to what was owing. Mr Church in the affidavit which I have just mentioned, raised very limited objections to those calculations. He accepted as a starting point that Constructions was owed $626,876.06, but asserted that $1,077,824.69 had to be deducted from that figure leaving a balance in favour of the plaintiff. "

Requirement: Action in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767-78A0052 Revision 2. Procedures that were accomplished previously in accordance with Revision 1 of the Service Bulletin, and that have not changed in Revision 2 of the Service Bulletin, need not be repeated. Note: FAA AD 92-16-02 Amdt 39-8311 refers. Compliance: Prior to 15 December 1992.

These wires should have a pin separation such that the DPV will not have power on adjacent pins. A bent pin in a wire bundle disconnect could contribute to an inadvertent deployment of the thrust reverser during an ‘auto-restow’ event. Amendment 1 was issued to align with FAA AD 92-06-13.

"What is the meaning of ""substantial and operative reason"" in the context of a worker's dismissal, as considered by the Court of Appeal in Bindaree Beef Pty Ltd v Riley [2013] NSWCA 305?","In the case of Bindaree Beef Pty Ltd v Riley [2013] NSWCA 305, the Court of Appeal, with Chief Justice Bathurst and her Honour Justice Beazley, considered the meaning of ""substantial and operative reason"". They held that the question of whether the injury was a substantial and operative cause of the worker's dismissal is a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances, including the employer's evidence as to such cause. The term ""operative"" is not superfluous in the section, and there could be more than one cause for the dismissal. The presumption will be rebutted if it is shown that the injury is not a substantial cause and one that is operative on the decision-maker at the relevant time.",new_south_wales,Kinninmont v Ku-ring-gai Council [2020] NSWIRComm 1064,"Substantial and operative provision 123. The Commission is not undertaking a broad-ranging assessment of the respondent’s actions and processes in these proceedings. The Commission’s consideration must focus on the “substantial and operative reason”, the meaning of which was considered by the Court of Appeal in Bindaree Beef Pty Ltd v Riley [2013] NSWCA 305 (“Bindaree”) by Chief Justice Bathurst with whom the President of the Court of Appeal, her Honour Justice Beazley, agreed, held at [53]: The question of whether the injury was a substantial and operative cause of the worker's dismissal is a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances including the employer's evidence as to such cause. 124. The Chief Justice continued in Bindaree at [58]-[61]: 58. I also do not agree with the Full Bench that the word operative is superfluous in the section. Section 244(2) recognises that there could be more than one cause for the dismissal. The presumption will be rebutted if it is shown that the injury is not a substantial cause and one that is operative on the decision-maker at the relevant time. In General Motors Holden Pty Ltd v Bowling (1976) 12 ALR 605, the respondent was alleged to have been dismissed by reason of him being a delegate of an industrial organisation. Such a dismissal was an offence under s 5(1) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth).

"In the case of Clurname Pty Limited v McGraw-Hill Financial, Inc [2017] FCA 1319, how did the court determine the location where a statement was made, when it was initiated in one place and received in another?","In the case of Clurname Pty Limited v McGraw-Hill Financial, Inc [2017] FCA 1319, the court determined the location where a statement was made by considering the events and asking where, in substance, the act took place. If a statement is directed from one place to another where it is known or even anticipated that it will be received by the plaintiff, the statement was, in substance, made at the place to which it was directed. This is true even if the statement is directed to a place from where it ought reasonably to be expected that it will be brought to the attention of the plaintiff, even if it is brought to attention in some third place. The court rejected the argument that the act took place in New York because that was the place where Standard & Poor’s determined its ratings methodologies, criteria and model assumptions. The court found that the relevant tortious conduct was Standard & Poor’s making the S&P Ratings Representations and the S&P Independence Representations in circumstances where it knew and authorised the communication of those representations to investors in Australia, or where it knew or could reasonably expect that the representations would be received and relied on by investors in Australia.",commonwealth,"Clurname Pty Limited v McGraw-Hill Financial, Inc [2017] FCA 1319"," If a statement is directed from one place to another place where it is known or even anticipated that it will be received by the plaintiff, there is no difficulty in saying that the statement was, in substance, made at the place to which it was directed, whether or not it is there acted upon.

At paragraph 197 I said this: The tax figures shown in Exhibit EE, with respect, cannot be correct, even allowing for the more generous marginal tax rates for lower income earners current these days. The second defendant does not disagree with the correctness of that statement. 9However the second defendant's approach is essentially that the Fox v Wood component, although not properly characterised as such in legal principle, is a bookkeeping entry to ensure that the plaintiff is not any worse off, after one takes account of the effect of the recovery provisions of the Workers' Compensation legislation upon a receipt of damages. That is to say common law damages are assessed by looking at net income but from those damages a plaintiff has to repay gross amounts paid as weekly payments of compensation which have been subject to income tax. It is that inconsistency which underpins the statement of principle enunciated by the High Court in Fox v Wood (1981) 148 CLR 438."

The Honourable Justice Jessup was satisfied that the applicant was entitled to orders in those terms.",commonwealth,Huawei Technologies Company Ltd v Al Amri [2011] FCA 503,"4 In the absence of any Defence from the respondent, the applicant notified the respondent’s solicitor on the record, and the respondent himself, that it proposed to move for final judgment in default of the Defence today. The notification to the solicitor prompted an email from him by which it was advised that his firm was no longer the address for service of the respondent. No new address for service was provided, and no change of practitioner was either filed or notified. In the circumstances, it was, in my view, open to the applicant to continue to deal with the solicitor on the record. However, the applicant took the cautious approach of having the respondent himself notified of the nature of the application which would be made today, and I am satisfied from the affidavit of Emma Kate Mitchell, sworn on 11 May 2011, that that was done. 5 The applicant moves for judgment under O 35A r 3(2). That provision empowers the court to give judgment against the respondent for the relief to which the applicant appears to be entitled on its Statement of Claim, and which the court is satisfied that it has power to grant in the circumstances now obtaining. The Statement of Claim makes allegations as to the invalidity of the patent in suit, and is supported by full particulars. Those allegations have not been responded to. The case seems to be foursquare within the circumstances with which O 35A r 3(2)(c) is concerned. 6 The order which the applicant seeks is that the patent in suit be wholly revoked, and that the respondent pay its costs.

To restate the opposing positions of senior counsel for the plaintiff and counsel for Deicorp and Calcono with great succinctness, the former simply submitted that the plaintiff and Mr Vujatovic were to be believed about the circumstances of the fall, in particular that the general location of the fall was wet, and there were no cross-braces on the raised platform. 232. To the contrary, counsel for the second and third defendants submitted that it was Mr Reeves who was to be believed; again, he submitted that I would not accept that the location was anything other than dry, and furthermore I would accept the evidence of Mr Reeves that cross-braces on the first level above the ground were indeed in place within the metal frames. 233. I shall not recount their particular submissions on this topic in greater detail than that; they can be understood by my summary of the cross-examination of those witnesses, along with references that appear in my determination below. 234. The task of determining the significant disputes between the plaintiff and Deicorp and Calcono about the circumstances in which the plaintiff fell is not an easy one. The following factors have been borne in mind by me in that task. 235. First, neither Mr Reeves nor Mr Vujatovic was shown in cross-examination, by way of demeanour or anything else, to be a dishonest person. 236. Secondly, my adverse finding about the credibility of the plaintiff about the degree of his injuries and disabilities (which I shall discuss in more detail shortly) inevitably also calls into question his credibility with regard to the fall itself. That factor is not determinative, however, and needs to be seen in the context of all of the evidence, and indeed the absence of evidence, about the fall."

There is no allegation that the TGA directed Loxias to cease distribution. The pleadings only allege that the TGA advised Loxias of the fact that there was a risk of selling products that could involve Loxias in false advertising. It is submitted that it was a voluntary act on Loxias’ part and as such, paragraph 60 should be struck out. Paragraphs 61 and 62 should be struck out as there is no proper pleading as to how the claimed expenditure came to be wasted.

"In the case of Searle v Transport for NSW [2017] NSWCATAD 256, what was the decision regarding the public interest considerations for the disclosure of information related to the Sydney Light Rail Delivery Office's problems with stakeholders?","In the case of Searle v Transport for NSW [2017] NSWCATAD 256, it was found that the public interest considerations in favour of disclosing information about the Sydney Light Rail Delivery Office's problems with stakeholders outweighed the public interest considerations against such disclosure. This decision was made under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW), section 13. However, the decision was subject to a proviso that the court had not yet determined whether there was an overriding public interest against disclosure of the information identifying interviewees, which was contained in a schedule to each document. The court also found that the respondent, Transport for NSW, had not discharged its onus of demonstrating that there was an overriding public interest against disclosure of the information sought by Mr Searle.",new_south_wales,Searle v Transport for NSW [2017] NSWCATAD 256,"145. There is a significant public interest in disclosure of information concerning problems the Sydney Light Rail Delivery Office is having with stakeholders and information which contains criticisms of particular stakeholders. This is information which is relevant to the progress of the project and the way it is being managed. The public interest against disclosure of this information is that it could reasonably be expected to prejudice the effective exercise by Transport for NSW (through the Sydney Light Rail Delivery Office) of its functions. Transport for NSW has not demonstrated in any concrete way how disclosure of the information would make the exercise of its functions less effective. I accept, in general terms, that disclosure of the information could damage its relationship with stakeholders, and that this could make the Office less effective when managing the project. However, without evidence of a more specific nature as to how the Office would be rendered less effective in the exercise of its functions, I am not prepared to give this consideration significant weight. 146. I find, on balance, that the public interest considerations in favour of disclosure of information in the Documents outweighs the public interest consideration against such disclosure (GIPA Act, s 13). This is subject to the proviso that I have not yet determined whether there is an overriding public interest against disclosure of the information identifying interviewees, which is contained in a schedule to each document. 147. Accordingly, subject to the proviso referred to above, I find that the respondent has not discharged its onus of demonstrating that there is an overriding public interest against disclosure of the information sought by Mr Searle."

"In the context of New South Wales law, what considerations should be made when determining whether a document was made or written or verified by a witness as accurate?","According to the decision in R v DX (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 165, the court should consider whether the document was made or written or verified by the witness as accurate at a time when the facts were fresh in the memory of the witness. This interpretation is supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report (ALRC 26, volume 1, para 165). The court should be cautious of documents made many years after the events recorded, as they may not accurately reflect the witness's memory when the events were fresh.",new_south_wales,R v DX (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 165,"6. I agree with Ms Goodwin's submission. It seems to me to be supported by the observations contained in the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report (ALRC 26, volume 1, para 165) which says that the ""specific matters to be considered by the Court include whether the document was made or written or verified by the witness as accurate at a time when the facts were fresh in"" the memory of the witness. It seems to me that the phrase must be interpreted in light of that. If it were not so it would mean that - just in this case - a witness who had made a statement some fifteen years after an event would be able to refresh their memory from it even though it was many years after the events recorded and many years after those events could be said to be fresh in the witness's memory. The alternative interpretation Ms Goodwin submits would defeat the purpose of the section and I agree with her."

"In the case of Murdaca v RAMS Mortgage Corporation Ltd [2007] NSWSC 512, what was Mr Murdaca's argument regarding the distinction between his case and the Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia case?","In the case of Murdaca v RAMS Mortgage Corporation Ltd [2007] NSWSC 512, Mr Murdaca argued that his case was distinguishable from the Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia case because in Bryant, Lockhart J paid particular attention to the fact that the bankruptcy had come about through the same problem as was the subject of the action, whereas in his case that was not so.",new_south_wales,Murdaca v RAMS Mortgage Corporation Ltd [2007] NSWSC 512," “It is understandable that a person unversed in the principles of statutory construction and unaware of legal authority on the meaning of s 60(4)(a) of the Act should have taken the words ‘wrong done to the bankrupt’ in isolation and concluded, as the claimant did about their meaning. However, the words cannot be taken in isolation. They must, in accordance with the ordinary canons of construction, be read in the context in which they appear.” 15 His Honour then went on to refer to Cox v Journeaux and other cases of authority such as the judgment of Lord Atkinson in Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd [1920] AC 102, 128-133 and the decision of Lockhart J in Faulkner v Bluett (1981) 52 FLR 115. 16 Both Mr Ashhurst and Mr Murdaca referred me to the decision of the full Federal Court in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1997) 75 FCR 545. In that case both Lockhart J and the other members of the court followed the line of authority to which I have referred and applied at 564 what Handley JA said in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the Mannigel case. 17 Mr Murdaca says that the present case is distinguishable from Bryant because in Bryant it seems that Lockhart J paid particular attention to the fact that the bankruptcy had come about through the same problem as was the subject of the action, whereas in the present case that was not so. I take the point, but with respect it is not the only reason why the Federal Court decided the matter the way it did. "

The court preferred the evidence of Ms Wong to that of Mr Yang.",new_south_wales,Yang v Westpac [2011] NSWSC 180,"57The most likely explanation is that Ms Wong got Mr Yang to sign before those details were obtained and, an agreement having been reached that the fee would be a $1,000, she changed the $660, added the dates and signed having obtained the information from Mr Yu. 58While that course of events is not desirable, it does not cause me to alter my view of the credibility of Ms Wong. 59Ms Wong maintained that the PDS revealed that the interest was fixed for the term. It clearly does not. But both she and Mr Leung insisted that the product was designed for a fixed interest rate. That was the way in which they administered the product. 60At the same time as Mr Yang says he had serious concerns that the market would fall and he wanted to pull out of the entire PEL investment he took up $100,000 worth of BT shares. That undermines his assertion. 61For all these reasons I prefer the evidence of Ms Wong to that of Mr Yang. I find that the representation alleged to have been made at the first meeting in July 2007 to the effect that variable interest rates were available with PEL products was not made."
"In the context of an intermediate court of appeal in New South Wales, what factors should be considered when deciding whether to grant a stay or injunction?","In the case of Tyndall v ACN 062 895 774 Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 102, it was observed that an intermediate court of appeal should consider several factors when deciding whether to grant a stay or injunction. These include the prospects of success in the case, the likelihood of a grant of special leave, and whether a successful appeal would make any practical difference to the rights and interests of the appellant unless a stay or injunction was granted. The court should also consider the effect of not granting a stay or an injunction on the rights, obligations, or interest of the putative appellant. One of the formulations adopted in certain circumstances is that of preserving the subject matter of the litigation.",new_south_wales,Tyndall v ACN 062 895 774 Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 102," 13 His Honour regarded the cases to which he referred in support of that proposition as also being authority for the proposition that an intermediate court of appeal should not be diffident about granting a stay or injunction in an appropriate case, notwithstanding the difficulty that may sometimes be occasioned for a member of an intermediate court of appeal in making an assessment of the prospects of a grant of special leave in a particular case. His Honour observed (at [12]) that it was always material to look at the prospects of success relevantly in such a case, the prospects of a grant of special leave and also whether or not the prospects of a successful appeal would make any practical difference to the rights and interests of the appellant unless a stay or injunction was granted. 14 Dealing with the latter factor his Honour pointed out that various formulations had been adopted as appropriate to the particular circumstances of a case, one of which was that of preserving the subject matter of the litigation. His Honour then set out a number of variations on that verbal formula, including foreclosing the utility of an appeal. As his Honour pointed out (at [14]) all of these formulations relate to the effect of not granting a stay or an injunction on the rights or obligations or interest of the putative appellant. "

Equally, the lack of a conviction is consistent with the continuation of an on-going employment relationship. It is uncertain as to when the trial of the criminal proceedings will occur. Conversely this Court is able to offer an early trial date of the review to the parties in a time frame in which I am informed by counsel that the parties are confident that the matter can be concluded. Consequently, I am not satisfied that the employer has demonstrated a reason or an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of the Court’s discretion in its favour to grant a stay.

"In the case of R v PERRIM [2016] NSWDC 426, how did the court assess the moral culpability of the prisoner?","In the case of R v PERRIM [2016] NSWDC 426, the court assessed the moral culpability of the prisoner as high. This was due to several factors including his attempt to avoid police stopping his motor vehicle, his inexperience as a driver, and his deliberate decision to drive in a certain way to avoid what was considered a minor consequence compared to the consequences that have now fallen upon the family of the deceased. The length of the journey and the risk to others were also taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.",new_south_wales,R v PERRIM [2016] NSWDC 426,"49. In the course of assessing the relevance of the guideline in a particular sentencing exercise of course the Court is required to undertake an assessment of the moral culpability and the extent of “abandonment of responsibility” in order to bring relevance of the guideline fixed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Whyte to the particular sentencing exercise. That issue does not arise in this particular case for the reason I am dealing with a more serious version of that type of offending. 50. It must be said however, that in various respects the moral culpability of the prisoner is high. It is high because amongst other things, as pleaded in the charge, he was endeavouring to avoid police stopping his motor vehicle. His moral culpability is high because he was an inexperienced driver. His moral culpability is high because the facts made clear on his own admission, as do the statements of the surviving witness within the car, that he deliberately drove the way he did to avoid what could only be described in context a minor consequence compared to the consequences that have now fallen upon the family of the deceased. Of course the length of journey and the risk to others is a relevant matter to take into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence."

What conditions were applied to the design of the pergola and balcony in the case of Waters v Leichhardt Municipal Council [2006] NSWLEC 26 in New South Wales?,"In the case of Waters v Leichhardt Municipal Council [2006] NSWLEC 26, the court applied several conditions to the design of the pergola and balcony. These included the requirement that the pergola over the Bedroom No. 3 balcony should not be supported on a post at the outward corner of the balcony, there should be no infil panel above balustrade level on both the balcony and the terrace, and that the pergola should be set in 400 mm from the west wall of Bedroom No. 3 to match with the balcony as shown on the Street Elevation Drawing No. 0408/DA08b.

This post extends down to the ground floor terrace. Unexplained lines on the plan and elevation may indicate infil panels on the sides of the balcony and terrace between the post and the front wall of the house. This would be contrary to the stated intention of the applicant. Also on the roof plan the pergola is shown having no setback from the west wall. It seems to me the pergola, and the balcony could easily be designed in cantilever rather than needing the post. 28 I intend to apply a condition requiring no post, no infil panel above balustrade level on both the balcony and the terrace, and that the pergola be set in 400 mm from the west wall of Bed Room No. 3 to match with the balcony as shown on the Street Elevation Drawing No. 0408/DA08b. 29 The roof is shown at 4 degree pitch. Sheet metal roofs such as that can be pitched as low as 2 degrees and that would enable the ceiling of the Bedrooms at the Street Elevation to be lowered to 2.7 m instead of 3 m and the roof lowered the same amount. 30 The conditions to that effect go as far as reasonable to achieve view sharing and compensate for not stepping or sloping of the roof edges.

The produce of the 2002 and 2003 vintages had been lodged with Harmans Ridge Winery, which had a claim of $131,000. As a result, the Mowen Group suffered significant cash flow distress.

MGM has incurred substantial costs in operating the vineyard and is entitled to be reimbursed. Non-payment of management fees has further affected this position. The produce of the 2002 and 2003 vintages has been lodged with Harmans Ridge Winery in relation to which that winery has a claim of $131 000. The result is that the Mowen Group has suffered significant cash flow distress. 23 It is stated by Mr MacLeod that he believes that part of the intentions of the applicants and Mr Joyce and Mr Lingard is to attempt to force the Mowen Group into such a difficult cash-flow position that it will not proceed with its defence and its cross-claims in the litigation. He asserts that the cross-claim is strong and valid and has been brought bona fide. 24 His evidence is that if the security for costs order is made against the cross-claimants in favour of the second cross-respondents it would greatly prejudice the ability of the cross-claimants to defend the claims which have been brought against them and to proceed with their cross-claims because their current cash position is such that they would not be able to continue with the litigation. 25 In relation to the evidence of Mr MacLeod that the debt secured over the Mowen vineyard is in the vicinity of $410 000, Mr MacLennan’s affidavit states that the maximum secured under the mortgage appears to be $600 000 and that the land is subject to a caveat in favour of Tropical."

The defendant's Senior Counsel submitted that due to the timing of the plaintiff's turn, no matter what speed the defendant was travelling, she would have been unable to see the plaintiff until the turn had been effected, that is until the plaintiff's vehicle was in the defendant's lane immediately in front of the defendant.",new_south_wales,Kelly v Carroll [2002] NSWCA 9," 29 It seems unquestionable that there was a car and unquestionable that the plaintiff treated the existence of that car turning left as something which afforded her an opportunity to move out into the traffic. The trial judge’s finding that the plaintiff saw a break in the traffic that caused her to begin her manoeuvre is said in the defendant’s written submissions not to be challenged. Cars travelling at 60 kilometres per hour normally slow down considerably when turning left. There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the car turning left was moving only slowly. 30 In my opinion the various attacks and criticisms advanced by the defendant against the trial judge’s reasoning, while to a limited extent successful, are not sufficient to invalidate his conclusion that there was negligence. The defendant’s argument on causation 31 The defendant then attacked the trial judge’s conclusion on causation: “Further, there was no basis for finding that any action of the Appellant played any causative role in the accident. As submitted by the Appellant’s Senior Counsel in the Court below, because of the timing of the Respondent’s turn, no matter what speed the Appellant was travelling, she would have been unable to see the Respondent until the turn had been effected, that is until the Respondent’s vehicle was in the Appellant’s lane immediately in front of the Appellant.” However, had both vehicles been moving slowly the accident would have been avoided.

The first defendants were considered to have a considerably higher responsibility, and were therefore ordered to pay $100,000. The second defendant was ordered to pay $40,000. The third defendant's liability was determined under the Act, with the plaintiff entitled to 16% of the maximum amount under s79(3) of the Act. The maximum amount was $250,000, 16% of which is $40,000. After a deduction of $20,500 in accordance with s79(5), the resultant figure was $19,500. Half the amount awarded against the first defendants was considered referable to the past and attracted interest at the usual rate of 2%.

Undoubtedly, the plaintiff’s back problem is the most serious aspect of his condition and the first defendants face a considerably higher assessment than the others. Against them I would award $100,000. Against the second defendant I would award $40,000. As to the third defendant, I consider that the plaintiff is entitled to 16% of the maximum amount under s79(3) of the Act. For present purposes, that maximum is $250,000, 16% of which is $40,000. After a deduction of $20,500 in accordance with s79(5), the resultant figure is $19,500. 36 I consider that half the amount awarded against the first defendants is referable to the past and should attract interest at the usual rate of 2%. The awards against the second and third defendants do not attract interest: as to the second defendant, by s35D(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1942; and as against the third defendant, by s73(3) of the Motor Accidents Act.

This was perplexing as there was evidence to suggest that Mortlake may have owed Antqip something in the vicinity of $600,000 around that time. Mr. Russell was not able to provide any satisfactory explanation for him not having notified the administrators of Antqip’s claim around the time of the creditors’ meeting.",commonwealth,Kassem and Secatore v Commissioner of Taxation [2012] FCA 152,"20 The failure of Mr Russell to notify the administrators and other creditors of Antqip’s claim against Mortlake is somewhat perplexing. There is evidence to suggest that Mortlake may have owed Antqip something in the vicinity of $600,000 around that time. Mr Russell was not able to provide any satisfactory explanation for him not having notified the administrators of Antqip’s claim around the time of the creditors’ meeting. Be that as it may, I am not satisfied that it is to be explained on the basis that Antqip was not owed any money by Mortlake. There is ample evidence before me that points strongly in favour of the conclusion that over a considerable period of time, Antqip was paying money to Mortlake or to Mortlake’s creditors in order to help Mortlake stay afloat. Quite apart from the payments the subject of these proceedings, there is evidence that shows that during 2006 and 2007 Antqip was making payments on account of Mortlake’s liability to the Commissioner for GST."

In response to these considerations, the Crown maintains that the offence committed was a “serious” contravention of s 6(1)(a). The sentence imposed was the first for an offence under s 6(1), and s 7(1) having a lower maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, the Crown does not rely on the difference between that sentence and sentences imposed in cases said to be comparable. Instead, it submits that offences of the nature committed by the respondent “threaten and endanger Australia’s international reputation and standing and the peace and harmony of the Australian community, particularly when motivated by religious and ideological beliefs which place adherence and obligation on one’s faith ahead of compliance with the law”. 38. While conduct proscribed by s 6 could involve activity in the nature of terrorism in the foreign state, there is no reference to terrorism in the elements of the offences created by that section: see R v Succarieh; R v Succarieh; Ex parte Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2017] QCA 85 at [139] (McMurdo JA, Bond J agreeing).

They claimed that they had called for undertakings from Dr Burmeister on pain of instituting proceedings, and that before they could institute them, Dr Burmeister commenced proceedings in Victoria, in a case of “forum shopping”.

This morning, in another unusual feature, the Court had the benefit at a directions hearing of the appearance of senior counsel on both sides. 9. Monash seeks the fixing of an early hearing date (even a provisional one) and appropriate directions to get the matter ready. It puts that its proceedings have been regularly commenced and it seeks the expedition which this Court can, and is expected to give, commercial disputes of substance. It argues that the party seeking to enforce the restraint, is the natural moving party. It says that it called for undertakings from the doctor on pain of instituting proceedings, and that before it could institute them, the doctor commenced in Victoria, in a clear case of “forum shopping”. I was referred to the decision of Gummow J in Kawasaki Steel Corporation v Owners and Others Interested in the Ship “Daeyang Honey” (1993) 120 ALR 109 at 114 on this topic, in the context of seeking negative declaratory relief. 10.

That proposition was not put to Mr Fox in the course of his evidence. In any event, Mr Atkins does not purport to have sought to settle the dispute other than by: · making it clear to Mr Fox that the Company’s withdrawal of the fly-in, fly-out arrangement was not negotiable; and · explaining that Mr Atkins was seeking to cut costs because the mine was losing money. It is fair to say that Mr Fox inferred in any event that that was the reason for Mr Atkins' actions, though Mr Fox attributes his knowledge of that motivation to rumours which were circulating in the camp. Eventually, probably in early November, Mr Fox took the last step in the dispute resolution procedure by writing to the Chief Commissioner of the W.A. Industrial Relations Commission, bringing the Chief Commissioner’s attention to the dispute between himself and the Company and seeking the Chief Commissioner’s help in resolving the dispute. There was no evidence of any other employee bringing their complaint to this level of the dispute resolution procedure. Within two or three days of that letter being sent, Mr Fox received a phone call from Mr Atkins. He made notes of the content of that call soon after speaking with Mr Atkins. Mr Fox used those notes to refresh his memory during his evidence and they were tendered into evidence."

Exhibit A included a pre-sentence report under the hand of Ms L Shardlow dated 28 June 2017. That report set out the offender’s history of supervision by Community Corrections which revealed that her response to supervision previously had been considered unsatisfactory due to her illicit substance use. Under the heading “Family/Social Circumstances”, the report noted that the offender was born in Lebanon and had been adopted as a very young child. When she discovered that at 10 years of age, her relationship with her adoptive family had become at times, tenuous. Since the offences, the offender’s relationship with her mother had improved, however, there was still concerns about her commitment to follow through with making more positive choices in terms of her peers and addressing her illicit substance abuse. The family was, however, supportive, particularly of her entering long-term residential rehabilitation."

I appreciate that it is the plaintiff's contention that he is ultimately at risk of conviction in respect of a serious criminal offence. However, I have before me an application under section 21 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) to review the order that Magistrate O'Shane made on 16 December 2002. Desirable as it may be for the plaintiff to have the benefit of legal representation upon this hearing, the fair trial considerations with which the Court in Dietrich was concerned do not seem to me to be raised by the present proceeding. This does not mean that it would not be open to me to vacate today's hearing date in order to give the plaintiff the opportunity to obtain legal representation in an appropriate case. 13. In considering the application, I have taken into account the chronology that I referred to in my reasons for decision given earlier today. I do not propose to repeat the details. It is sufficient to note that there has been very considerable delay in the proceedings being brought on for hearing. 14. The evidence suggests that the applicant is not eligible for a grant of legal aid from the Legal Aid Commission. It does not appear that he meets the criteria for the grant of pro bono legal assistance by the Bar Association of New South Wales, the Law Society, or under the pro bono scheme coordinated by the Public Interest Legal Clearing House. Kingsford Legal Centre has made admirable efforts on the plaintiff's behalf to date without success. I do not consider it likely were I do to adjourn the proceedings for a short interval that the applicant would be able to obtain representation. "

He approached his sister and negotiated with Mr Conrad so that the money would be paid to or at the direction of St George Bank, preventing the bank from taking possession of his property.",new_south_wales,Prentice v St George Bank [2002] NSWSC 358," 36 The critical question is whether, when Mr Armstrong contacted Mr Conrad of St George on 25 February 2000 to ask him which account to put the money into, he was acting in a purely personal capacity, or as the sole director of a corporate debtor. There is some significance in the way he framed the question. He invited Mr Conrad to specify either the overdraft account, a corporate account, or the home loan account, a personal account. This could be taken to imply that if Mr Conrad were to specify the overdraft account (as in fact he did), Mr Armstrong as the director of Macquarie would cause the company to authorise payment. However, in my opinion such a construction of the conversation between Mr Armstrong and Mr Conrad would be inaccurate. 37 From December 1999, St George had commenced to dishonour cheques drawn on Macquarie's account, but Mr Armstrong’s conduct in February 2000 was not for the purpose of resuscitating the account. The evidence makes it plain that he approached his sister and negotiated with Mr Conrad because there was a possession order against him requiring him to vacate his home by 10:30 am on 25 February 2000. His actions were focused on avoiding eviction. As both he and his sister said in evidence, the money was to be paid to or at the direction of St George so that St George would not take possession of his property. "

There is no evidence of any other or earlier donation to the Bumi Sehat Foundation, and I am not satisfied this was a “further” donation. It is likely to have been the only donation. Ms Gibson broke down this donation of $5,000 in an email to Bee Wah Ang of Consumer Affairs Victoria on 15 March 2015. Ms Gibson stated that a total of $2,790 was raised through the app sales during the Mother’s Day event. An additional amount was raised as part of the $1 donations made by Ms Gibson or her company, following the “what ‘Family means to you’” stories. According to Ms Gibson’s email (which I am prepared to treat as an admission), $4,000 was raised for Bumi Sehat Foundation, comprising the $2,790 and the $1 donations.

Thus, even where the IAA considers that subparagraph (i) is satisfied, it is incumbent on the IAA to consider whether or not subparagraph (ii) is satisfied. 13 In the present case, the IAA considered the “new information” issue in relation to the TRC Letter at paragraphs 7 and 8 of its decision. In paragraph 7, the IAA stated that it considered the TRC Letter to be new information. In paragraph 8, the IAA accepted that this new information “could not have been provided to the department before the decision was taken to refuse the [appellant’s] PV application”. The IAA therefore, in substance, considered subparagraph (i) of s 473DD(b). However, in my view, the IAA did not consider subparagraph (ii) of s 473DD(b). The IAA did not refer to subparagraph (ii). Nor did it refer to the question posed by subparagraph (ii), namely, whether the new information was “credible personal information which was not previously known and, had it been known, may have affected the consideration of the referred applicant’s claims”."

"In the context of New South Wales law, under what circumstances can a party withdraw an admission they have made in court?","According to the decision in SLE Worldwide v WGB & Ors [2005] NSWSC 816, a party can withdraw an admission they have made in court under certain circumstances. If a party without any apparent disability makes a clear and distinct admission that is accepted by its opponent and acted upon, an application to withdraw the admission should not be freely granted, especially at appeal. However, the question of whether to allow the withdrawal of an admission is one for the reviewing judge to consider in the context of each particular appeal. The general guideline is that the person seeking to withdraw a concession made should provide some good reason why the judge should disturb what was previously common ground or conceded. Furthermore, if a court is satisfied that admissions have been made after consideration and advice such as from the parties’ expert and after a full opportunity to consider its case and whether the admissions should be made, admissions so made with deliberateness and formality would ordinarily not be permitted to be withdrawn. The court will not lend its approval to the withdrawal of admissions where this is actuated by purely tactical reasons.",new_south_wales,SLE Worldwide v WGB & Ors [2005] NSWSC 816,"“1.

It should be said immediately, in light of the criticisms levied against the reasoning which was incorporated as part of the certificate, that Dr Meakin gave a careful summary of the enormous volume of historical material and conflicting medical opinions which the parties had provided. In particular, in circumstances where it would have been easy to rely merely upon the parties’ submissions, Dr Meakin’s summary of the historical opinions by various medical practitioners makes it plain that he had read them independently. His reasons also make it plain that he had independently reviewed the photographic evidence of the motor vehicle accident (which he described in different terms from the descriptions in the parties’ submissions) and he gave a much fuller chronological account of the history provided by Mr Keen. It should also be noted that no criticism was made of the clinical examination that Dr Meakin undertook. 9. There is no doubt that Dr Meakin apprehended the gravamen of Dr Dalton’s views.

These reasons also apply here, albeit in slightly different circumstances. While in this case a deed was entered into under which the First, Second, Third and Fourth Respondents agreed to surrender the first DA as part of the process of lodging the second DA, that was done without admission as to the substantive matters in the proceedings. It is also clear from the Council’s planning report of March 2007 in exhibit A that it was also aware of the settlement discussions between the other parties. The Council was bound to accept and process the second DA lodged in any event. The fact it did so does not allow the Applicant to establish that there was surrender by the Respondents in the context of the proceedings. None of the substantive matters have been determined. 26 I consider the appropriate costs order is that there should be no order as to costs. I do not accept the alternative submission that the Applicant should pay the Council’s costs because he commenced and then effectively abandoned these proceedings. 27 This finding means that I do not need to consider the arguments made in reliance on Cutcliffe as the threshold to the application of the principles at [15] of that decision is that the Applicant is successful.

"In the context of Australian immigration law, does the application of the natural justice hearing rule exclude dealings with offshore visa applicants?","According to the decision in BXK15 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2018] FCAFC 76, the application of the natural justice hearing rule does not exclude dealings with offshore visa applicants.

Therefore, the application of the hearing rule in dealings with the appellant's application is not excluded by subdiv AB.",commonwealth,BXK15 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2018] FCAFC 76," 41 A point made by Lindgren J in NAQF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is that the “matters” “dealt with” in the subdivision cannot be simply equated with the procedural requirements of its operative provisions , for s 51A(1) would then be largely otiose. Thus, if the matter dealt with by s 57 was the giving of information fulfilling the description of “relevant information” to a visa applicant for comment, s 51A would operate so that it was exhaustive of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule so far as concerned the giving of information only of that kind. A limited purpose would then be achieved by s 51A(1). The rule would continue to apply to the provision of other information. The search, as his Honour said, is for a larger subject matter or matters . 42 In order to give s 51A operation it is necessary to refer to the subject of the “matter” with which s 57 deals as the provision of information, more generally relevant and adverse, for comment. But there is a qualification to the description of the “matter”, which arises from the persons to whom the information is to be provided. The terms of the section limit such persons to onshore visa applicants. The “matter” with which s 57 deals, is the provision of such information to onshore visa applicants. The provision of information to offshore visa applicants, such as the appellant, is not a “matter” dealt with by the sub section. It follows that the application of the hearing rule in dealings with the appellant's application is not excluded by subdiv AB. [Footnote references omitted]"

Before the Appeal Panel are two internal appeals from decisions of the Tribunal’s Consumer and Commercial Division. Each appeal concerns decisions relating to claims for compensation by the appellant for breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment at social housing premises leased from the respondent. 2. For the reasons below in each appeal, leave to appeal is refused and the appeals are dismissed. The Proceedings at First Instance 3. There were, relevantly, two separate proceedings involving the parties which were decided by the Tribunal on 28 November 2019 (SH 1839320) and on 5 December 2019 (SH 19/21805). In both proceedings the appellant had claimed compensation for breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment. 4. The appellant as tenant and the respondent as landlord entered into a residential tenancy agreement on 26 March 2013. The appellant was housed in a two (2) bedroom double storey townhouse within a complex of eight (8) townhouses. He resided originally in unit 7 of the complex, but issues arose from alleged misconduct of the unit 8 occupants of the complex. The appellant brought proceedings in the Tribunal against the respondent in 2017 for a breach of the landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment. Those proceedings were settled by way of payment of $3,000 to the appellant. 5. The appellant was re-settled out of unit 7 to other social housing premises in January 2019."

Can a solicitor's bill of costs attract legal professional privilege in the Commonwealth jurisdiction of Australia?,"Yes, a solicitor's bill of costs can attract legal professional privilege in the Commonwealth jurisdiction of Australia. This was unequivocally held by Sir Charles Hall VC in Turton v Barber (1874) LR 17 Eq. 329. Furthermore, this privilege is not waived by its inclusion in a solicitor's affidavit as to documents, as stated in the decision of Caddle Management Services Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1997] FCA 198.",commonwealth,Caddle Management Services Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1997] FCA 198,"Most of the documents consist of bills of costs and correspondence about them, principally between Mowbray Erdynast and Tower Life. Of their nature, bills of costs can disclose or indicate matters on which advice has been sought or given in preparation for litigation. As well, some of the correspondence on matters of costs concern issues entirely unrelated to the present litigation which would not be discoverable on any view. The rest of the documents in Mr Mowbray's list were essentially items of correspondence dealing with progress reports or requests for instructions concerning the present litigation, particularly interlocutory aspects of it. From this description of the documents, it can be seen that all of them fall within one or other of category (a) or category (e) of the six categories of privileged documents identified by Lockhart J in Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244. As well, it was unequivocally held by Sir Charles Hall VC in Turton v Barber (1874) LR 17 Eq. 329 that a solicitor's bill of costs can attract legal professional privilege which is not waived by its inclusion in a solicitor's affidavit as to documents. Moreover, I do not perceive that the detail of the bills of costs enumerated by Mr Mowbray, apart from the fact that they have been rendered, can cast any light on the issues to be litigated between the applicant and the Commissioner. Similar considerations apply to correspondence between the applicant's solicitors and Tower Life or the applicants about an agreement by Tower Life to make a contribution to the applicant's costs. Accordingly, as far as any exercise of discretion is involved in resolving whether the documents should be produced for inspection, I have concluded that the balance is strongly in favour of the applicant."

The grounds relied on by the appellant in this court are, on their face, manifestly inadequate as a basis for alleging error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.

The Tribunal was particularly concerned about this due to the strained relationship between the Applicant and the Respondent, and the Applicant's belief that she had been subjected to unfair and unjust treatment by the Respondent. The Tribunal questioned the Applicant's capacity to meaningfully engage with the Respondent and actively seek out its help and support if the children in her care were at risk.",new_south_wales,BXS v Department of Family and Community Services [2015] NSWCATAD 269,"126. That the Applicant, as Ms KP’s mother, loves and cares for her daughter and wishes for her to have contact with her children is not in dispute. However, the Tribunal is concerned that the Applicant lacks the ability to dispassionately and objectively manage situations and take appropriate protective steps in circumstances where the children in her care may be at risk of harm, either physical or psychological. This is of particular relevance given that, at the present time, a strained relationship exists between the Applicant and the Respondent, who the Applicant believes has subjected her to unfair and unjust treatment. As such, if the children were to be returned to her care, there is a legitimate question about the Applicant’s capacity to meaningfully engage with the Respondent and actively seek out its help and support if the children in her care were at risk. 127. The Tribunal carefully considered the Applicant’s submission, in the alternative to all three children being returned to the Applicant’s care, that only Miss K and Miss C be returned. The Tribunal takes into account the age of the girls and the fact that in less than three months’ time they will be able to instruct a legal representative (including in proceedings under the Care Act). The Tribunal is also cognisant of the principle outlined in section 9(2)(a) of the Act that the views of the child are to be given due weight in accordance with the developmental capacity of the child and the circumstances."

The gross sum costs order was determined to be $19,594, comprising solicitors' fees of $6,300, counsel's fees of $10,300 and the motion filing fee of $1,334. The court saw no reason to discount this figure.",new_south_wales,A.N.T. Building Pty Ltd v Vibe Electrical Pty Ltd [2023] NSWSC 615,"29. Mr Gleeson deposes that the Builder anticipates serving payment claims at the end of June and to receive funds in respect of those payment claims around the middle of July. In those circumstances, Mr Gleeson deposes that, were the Builder obliged to pay a sum on account of the costs of the Contractor's motion prior to that, it would ""need to pay that in priority to trades and suppliers and this will have adverse consequences on [the Builder] carrying out and complying with its contract obligations to its clients"". 30. It appears to me that it is not in the interests of either party that the Builder's ability to continue trading be jeopardised. 31. In those circumstances I am persuaded that I should vary what I said this morning and order that if the Builder does not pay the sum I propose to fix as the Contractor's costs of its motion by 28 July 2023, then the proceedings will stand dismissed. 32. As to what the gross sum costs order should be, I have received evidence from the Contractor's solicitor to the effect that the actual costs sustained by the Contractor is $19.594, comprising solicitors' fees of $6,300, counsel's fees of $10,300 and the motion filing fee of $1,334. 33. That total figure obviously represents the total of the costs actually incurred by the Contractor. I foreshadowed this morning that I would make an order that costs be on an indemnity basis. It may be that the total of $19,594 is marginally above the costs that the Contractor would recover on an indemnity basis. However, I see no reason to discount that figure for today's purpose. 34. The parties should bring in short minutes to give effect to these reasons."

What is the fundamental distinction between accord executory and accord and satisfaction as explained in the case of Soufflet Beheer v AWB Ltd (ACN 081 890 459) [2006] FCA 51?,"In the case of Soufflet Beheer v AWB Ltd (ACN 081 890 459) [2006] FCA 51, the court explained that the fundamental distinction between accord executory and accord and satisfaction is that the former does not operate to discharge existing rights and duties unless and until the accord is performed, whereas the latter operates as a discharge immediately the accord (or agreement) is achieved. Accord and satisfaction is the compromise of an existing cause of action in return for a promise while accord executory requires that something be done before the cause of action is compromised.",commonwealth,Soufflet Beheer v AWB Ltd (ACN 081 890 459) [2006] FCA 51," 56 Finally, AWB contended that, even if its fax was an offer seeking accord and satisfaction, Soufflet Négoce’s reply was not an acceptance of such an offer. This was because, so AWB submitted, the reply is expressed as being conditional on AWB ordering payment of the balance of Soufflet USA’s claim. AWB submitted that the use of the future tense in the expression “so that we can settle this file” is consistent only with the view that no agreement had been reached. DISCUSSION 57 This dispute is akin to a problem constructed for law students’ final exam in contracts. In essence, the Court is called upon to determine whether two written documents are, respectively, an offer and an acceptance. And, as one sometimes finds in the hypotheticals constructed for examination purposes, the purported ‘offer’ in this case is not an offer because there is no consideration. 58 Before analysing the key documents, it will be helpful to review the distinction between accord and satisfaction and accord executory. Phillips JA (with whom Winneke P and Charles JA agreed) provides an excellent outline of the relevant principles in Osborn v McDermott [1998] 3 VR 1 (“Osborn”). As Phillips JA explains, the fundamental distinction between accord executory and accord and satisfaction is that “the former does not operate to discharge existing rights and duties unless and until the accord is performed, whereas the latter operates as a discharge immediately the accord (or agreement) is achieved”: Osborn at 7-8. Accord and satisfaction is the compromise of an existing cause of action in return for a promise while accord executory requires that something be done before the cause of action is compromised."
"In the case of State of New South Wales v Hill [2016] NSWSC 913, what was Dr Eagle's opinion on the risk of re-offending by the individual under supervision?","In the case of State of New South Wales v Hill [2016] NSWSC 913, Dr Eagle expressed concern about the individual's risk of re-offending. Despite the individual's time in custody and under supervision, Dr Eagle noted that the individual still found it difficult to control his own actions and comply with the basic requirements of the supervision order. Dr Eagle suggested that if the supervision order was lifted, the individual might continue to engage in risky behaviour, such as substance use and exposure to vulnerable victims, potentially at a higher frequency. This could lead to a high risk of re-offending, particularly when the individual is intoxicated and his control is reduced.",new_south_wales,State of New South Wales v Hill [2016] NSWSC 913,"126. Dr Eagle’s evidence also contained the following: “HIS HONOUR: Allowing for the obvious fact he spent time in custody with presumably no access to the type of victims that were the victims of these offences, by taking into account the fact that he has been in the community for some considerable time since his release to parole, and bearing in mind the relationship between, if there is one, his sex offending as a young person and his current age, what do we get from the fact that he's been free of offending for so long? What does that tell us, if anything? A. I think that's very difficult to interpret in this case, given he has been either in custody or under supervision for that entire period. Q. I've built that in. A. Yes. Again, you know I think it's very difficult in these situations to know what the effect of that supervision has had in or role that supervision has had in preventing his re offending during that period. I think the concern for me are that he, despite all of the supervision that he has had and the treatments he's had, that he still finds it difficult to even control his own actions to the extent of complying with basic requirements of the supervision order with the knowledge that he could go back into custody. And so my concern would be that, given if you lifted the supervision order, that he would continue to engage in this type of behaviour, such as his substance use and exposure to vulnerable victims, but this would occur on a much higher frequency over, you know, whatever period of time, which he may be able to he may not intend to re-offend initially, but ultimately, if he is continually exposed to those high risk scenarios, that his risk of in fact re offending when he's intoxicated and when his control is reduced, is high.”"
What were the key issues in the case of Volt Australia Ltd & Anor v. Directories (Australia) Pty Ltd & Ors [1985] FCA 231?,"In the case of Volt Australia Ltd & Anor v. Directories (Australia) Pty Ltd & Ors [1985] FCA 231, the key issues revolved around misleading or deceptive conduct and passing off. The case involved the similarity of the name under which the applicant intended to trade and the name under which the respondent had traded in a similar business over a long period. The respondent had also sought to incorporate a company with a similar name to that under which the applicant intended to trade. The case also involved the question of interlocutory injunctive relief and whether there was a serious question to be tried. The entitlement to use descriptive expressions and trade marks was also a matter of contention.

In Cabal’s case, she remained separated from her four young children who are aged between 7 and 14. Karras, on the other hand, was prevented from completing her studies.

The consequence of each decision is that, subject to any further application for a Bridging E visa, each applicant remains in detention pending resolution of her application for a protection visa which might take some time. In Cabal’s case, that means she has been, and might for some time, remain separated from her four young children who are aged between 7 and 14.

In each case, the IRT gave no real reason other than past deception to support its implicit conclusion of a real present risk of further flight.

(b) If so, is reinstatement, together with the associated orders, appropriate and practicable relief. (c) Did the respondent, as an undischarged bankrupt, have standing to make and pursue the application. 8 We turn to consider first whether the respondent, as an undischarged bankrupt, had standing to bring an application pursuant to s 84 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996. It was common ground that the respondent was an undischarged bankrupt at the time he made his s 84 application. This was a matter that did not come to the attention of the appellant until after it had filed its notice of appeal and thus led to the need for the amendment granted. 9 Mr P Coleman, counsel for the appellant, submitted that the only person with standing to commence the proceedings was the respondent's trustee in bankruptcy. 10 The issue in these proceedings which arises from the respondent's bankruptcy is essentially whether his right to commence proceedings under s 84 of the Industrial Relations Act after his dismissal by the appellant was ""after-acquired property"" in terms of s 58 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and thus divisible among his creditors in terms of s 116 of that statute.

What is the extent of government control over religious organisations in China as described in the case of Zhang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1682?,"In the case of Zhang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1682, it was noted that the government control over religious organisations in China is primarily exercised through a registration process administered by the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau. This process allows the government to monitor membership in religious organisations, locations of meetings, selection of clergy, publication of religious materials, and funding for religious activities. The government also undertakes annual inspections of registered religious organisations. Failure to register can result in the imposition of fines, seizure of property, razing of ‘illegal’ religious structures, forcible dispersal of religious gatherings, and, occasionally, short term detention. While long-term imprisonment, violence and physical abuse by security forces against religious activists still occur, they appear to be less frequent than they were at the time of the first Human Rights Watch study of religion in China in 1992.",commonwealth,Zhang v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1682,"“[T]his may have occurred but there is no evidence of adverse consequences, despite his claim that several other followers were arrested following a house raid in February 1998.” 24 The Tribunal then said: “In some local areas, the government has enacted its control as old-style repression and prohibition. However, that is not government policy: the distinction is important. The government tolerates religions and religious groups if they acknowledge government regulations."" 25 The Tribunal then set out the extent of government control of churches by reference to page 344 of a report by Human Rights Watch Asia as follows: “Government control is exercised primarily through a registration process administered by the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau through which the government monitors membership in religious organisations, locations of meetings, selection of clergy, publication of religious materials, and funding for religious activities. The government also now undertakes annual inspections of registered religious organisations. Failure to register can result in the imposition of fines, seizure of property, razing of ‘illegal’ religious structures, forcible dispersal of religious gatherings, and, occasionally, short term detention. … While long-term imprisonment, violence and physical abuse by security forces against religious activists still occur, they appear to be less frequent than they were at the time of the first Human Rights Watch study of religion in China in 1992. In 1997, we found isolated cases but no evidence of wide-spread or systematic brutality. When reports of these harsher measures do surface they are increasingly denounced by the central government officials as examples of the excesses of local officials and their failure to implement policy directives correctly.”"

She had initially expected the cost to be about $5,000, but it became clear that she was unable to pay such a sum.",new_south_wales,Regina v DALTON [2005] NSWSC 137," 18 The important part of the conversation between Stewart and the accused occurred in the restaurant. Although the subject matter of the incitement was indirectly prompted by Stewart the accused volunteered why she wanted what she called “the job” done to Amy Kyle. It is quite clear that aside from finding someone to do the job (the accused’s description of Archer’ role) there was no suggestion by the accused that the instigation for the crime came from other than the accused and possibly her son. 19 The conversation is inconsistent with any suggestion that the proposal may have been instigated by Archer or, for that matter, by Stewart. The accused’s language demonstrates that she had been considering the matter for some time. In this conversation the accused also stated that she wanted Troy Scott killed for the reason, essentially, that he was attempting to take his child from the accused’s daughter. The accused wanted to have Scott killed first and explained why his case was more urgent. 20 There was a great deal of discussion about how the accused might raise Stewart’s fee. She had been expecting, perhaps because of what Archer had said (and he may have got that sum from Dalton), that it would cost about $5,000. It was soon obvious that she was completely unable to pay such a sum. In the end it was agreed that she would attempt to obtain $500 as a deposit and pay the balance each fortnight. Stewart explained that he needed the money to follow Kyle to where she used to drink. Towards the end of the conversation the accused said, “I’m thinkin the way things are going” - that is, concerning the cost - “if you get rid of him first and put the other one on hold.” "

The primary evidence adduced before the Tribunal concerned Alexia’s emotional well-being. The Tribunal found that it would be in Alexia’s best interests for Mr Leone’s visa cancellation to be revoked and accorded that factor significant weight.

In relation to the complaint about the use of statistics, it is important to set out the entirety of what her Honour said about statistics in her ROS: I have considered the statistics for this matter. For the offence of supply a prohibited drug being a commercial quantity of cocaine post-Muldrock, being s 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act with profile parameters consistent with this offender, that is, an individual, one offence only, Form 1 matter and a plea of guilty, there is a recorded sample of course cases of which all, being 100%, resulted in full-time custody. Sentences ranged from four years to five years imprisonment; non-parole periods were two and a half years and three years. Removing the profile factors resulted in a larger number of seventeen cases of which fifteen, being 88.2%, resulted in full-time imprisonment. Sentences ranged from three and a half years to six years imprisonment. Non-parole periods ranged from two to four years. The higher courts have referred to statistics as a blunt instrument and an opaque tool. They are less useful when there are a smaller number of cases making up the set, such as is the case here. They may serve as a yardstick against which to assess the proposed sentence and I take them into consideration but do not allow them to define the outer bounds of permissible discretion, see Barbaro v R [2014] 253 CLR 58.

"In the case of Meaden v Bell Potter Securities Limited (No 4) [2012] FCA 1469, what issues were raised regarding the structure and relevance of certain paragraphs and sub-paragraphs in the Schedule to the proposed subpoena?","In the decision of Meaden v Bell Potter Securities Limited (No 4) [2012] FCA 1469, the court identified structural problems with paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the proposed subpoena. The court found it difficult to identify relevant documents as there were a number of preconditions to fall within paragraph 1. The documents had to be in some sense in respect of an investigation conducted by ASIC, and that investigation had to relate to either the respondent, its directors, its officers or its agents, recommending the acquisition of PGL shares during that period. The court found it difficult to see how sub-paragraphs 2(k), 2(l), 2(m), and the Roman numerals (i), (iv), and (v) could be a subset of a recommendation to acquire PGL shares. The court also questioned the relevance of these sub-paragraphs, such as the hiring of employees and how they relate to the pleaded issue.",commonwealth,Meaden v Bell Potter Securities Limited (No 4) [2012] FCA 1469," (8) Then there are structural problems with para 2 of the Schedule to the proposed subpoena. Paragraph 2 is said to be for the avoidance of doubt and the documents sought in para 1 are “in particular, but not limited to” and so one would infer that subparas (a) to (m) – it then reverts to Roman numerals – (i) to (viii) – are presumably all intended to be either a subset of or instances of documents that would fall within para 1. But relevant documents are not easy to identify; there are a number of preconditions to fall within para 1. One has to have a document, it has to be a document in some sense in respect of an investigation conducted by ASIC, and that investigation has to relate to either the respondent, its directors, its officers or its agents, recommending the acquisition of PGL shares during that period. One then comes, for instance, to para 2(k); it is very difficult to see how that can be a subset of a recommendation to acquire PGL shares. Similarly, (l); similarly, (m); we then get into the Roman numerals, (i) cannot be a subset of documents about recommendations to buy PGL shares. In any event, that paragraph is plainly irrelevant. What relevance is there in hiring of employees? Which pleaded issue does that go to? Similarly, (iv): How is that a subset of documents relating to recommendations? Or (v)?"

Furthermore, they are accused of failing to take into account the contents of the ""Assessed Tax Invoice"", dated 8 April 2011, issued by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.

The court did not believe that the name ""Digital Post Australia"" or the website layout would lead any consumer to form the view that Digital Post Australia is connected or affiliated with Australia Post. The court also noted that the disclaimer at the bottom of the homepage of Digital Post Australia's website stating that it is not an Australia Post business should be considered.",commonwealth,Australian Postal Corporation v Digital Post Australia Pty Ltd [2012] FCA 372,"8 Of particular relevance to Australia Post’s misleading or deceptive conduct claim is DPA’s website. Exhibited to the affidavit of Natalie Jane Hickey sworn on 26 March 2012 are screenshots of the homepage of DPA’s website. At the bottom of the homepage is a disclaimer stating that: “Digital Post Australia… is not an Australia Post business”. Putting aside any disclaimer, the website does not found a strong case for misleading or deceptive conduct in my view. The way in which it is set out would not lead any consumer to form the view that DPA is connected or affiliated with Australia Post. Indeed, I do not think that the name “Digital Post Australia” in itself would cause any consumer to be misled or deceived in the way alleged by Australia Post. 9 The material before me indicates that there is a very weak case as far as Australia Post’s misleading or deceptive conduct claim is concerned. In saying this, I am aware that I should be careful not to ignore the possibility that a consumer may be ‘enticed’ to the website on the basis of any misleading or deceptive conduct on the part of DPA. As Counsel for Australia Post submitted, it is improper to then treat the disclaimer as somehow discounting that enticement. However, in my view, there is nothing of a misleading or deceptive nature in the enticement, that being the reference to “Digital Post Australia”. 10 Once one enters the website, one sees the words “Australia’s online postal service”. Australia Post submitted that this indicated some association with it. However, this text should be considered in the context in which it appears, having regard to the format of the website, the reference to “Digital Post Australia”, and, assuming one sees it, the disclaimer."

Those photographs would appear to provide a reasonable representation of the oil patch at the time of the fall, in that, although there are several tyre marks in the grease or oil, they do not cross the skid mark left by the Plaintiff’s heel. As will be noted below, this feature of the photographs has some relevance to the question of causation, because it suggests that more than one vehicle may have used Bay 31 after the spill occurred and prior to the fall. 16 How conspicuous the oil or grease patch may have been to the Plaintiff would have depended upon a number of factors including: (a) how many steps the Plaintiff would have taken after rounding the concrete pylon, within sight of the patch; "

However, he also stated that the receipt of these funds had considerably alleviated the cash flow issue.",commonwealth,Hillier v Martin (No 12) [2022] FCA 952,"57 Mr Martin also referred to a payment to a Nordburger entity in the amount of $540,000.00 as compensation from the State Government for the compulsory acquisition of a property from which the Nordburger Frewville restaurant formerly operated. He asserted that the delayed payment of compensation was a substantial reason for the tightened cash flow in the Nordburger group. He said that the receipt of the funds had alleviated the cash flow issue to a considerable degree. He went on to explain certain aged payables that were the subject of consideration in Hillier 11. 58 Mr Martin disclosed that there had been previous payment arrangements with the ATO which had lapsed due to a delay in filing tax returns for the 2020 and 2021 financial years. He deposed to an expectation that there would be a sizeable tax return in 2022 which would be allocated to paying down the ATO debt. Mr Martin asserted that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the profitability and trading position of the Nordburger business, but denied that the negative profitability was as severe as that asserted by Mr Hillier. 59 The affidavit of Mr Williams made on 28 April 2022 also annexes correspondence explaining why a debt to a bread supplier remained outstanding. It supports an inference that the failure to pay the debt may be due to circumstances relating to the quality of the supply and perhaps to a delay in the provision of invoices. In light of that evidence, I have no regard to the bread supplier debt for the purposes of the present application."

The court finds it logical to require the satisfaction of some conditions determined by reference to past events and some by reference to what is likely to be the case in the future. Despite the use of tenses in section 15B being considered clumsy, the court believes that this is how the section must be read.",new_south_wales,Piatti v ACN 000 246 542 Pty Ltd [2020] NSWCA 168,"61. I agree that subs (2)(a) directs attention to the position as at the date on which liability arose. However, as I have endeavoured to explain, in order to make sense of the section, it is necessary to consider subs (2)(c) and (d) in respect of both past and future loss of capacity as at the time damages are assessed. To complicate matters, subs (2)(b) appears to speak from alternating times according to the class of dependant in question. Nevertheless, I see no reason why, in a list of four conditions to the entitlement to an award of damages of a particular kind, each condition must be assessed at a point frozen in time.

"In the case of Buckley v R [2021] NSWCCA 6, how did the court consider the applicant's mental health issues in relation to his sentencing?","In Buckley v R [2021] NSWCCA 6, the court did not find the applicant's mental health issues, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression, to lessen his moral culpability for the offences he committed, as there was no evidence that these issues were causally related to his offending. However, the court did consider these mental health issues, as diagnosed by Dr Chew, in reducing the weight given to specific and general deterrence in the sentencing. This consideration was reflected in the indicative sentences and the aggregate sentence.",new_south_wales,Buckley v R [2021] NSWCCA 6,"98. In regard to the applicant’s mental health issues involving schizophrenia as well as anxiety and depression for which he is being treated in custody, I am of the view that these should not be found to lessen the applicant’s moral culpability in relation to the offending for which the applicant is being sentenced, in the absence of any evidence that they were causally related to that offending. To the extent that any of the offending was causally related to drug induced psychosis as a result of self-induced intoxication, I also accept that this is not a mitigating factor. Nonetheless I do find that the applicant’s mental health issues as diagnosed by Dr Chew should be taken into account so as to reduce to a certain extent the weight to be given to specific and general deterrence in this case. This is reflected in the indicative sentences and the aggregate sentence. 99. Given that this is the applicant’s first time in custody and he is likely to benefit from a longer period than is provided by the statutory ratio applicable under s 44(2B) of the Sentencing Procedure Act on parole under supervision and in order to undertake drug and alcohol rehabilitation, I find that there are special circumstances for the purposes of that provision. 100. There is in my view a need for very substantial notional concurrency in relation to the offences of possessing an unauthorised, imitation pistol and the use of an offensive weapon, being the imitation pistol, to prevent police investigation. In addition, a consideration of all the offending and the indicative sentences in the circumstances requires further notional concurrency so that the aggregate sentence appropriately reflects the totality of the criminal behaviour involved in the present case in all the circumstances."

He alleged that in the course of loading the trailer he was required to stand on top of the load to tighten the chains used for securing the load and that in the course of doing this, the chain slipped and loosened resulting in the load moving thereby causing him to lose his balance and fall to the ground. He alleged that the appellant was negligent in some 12 respects – of which, at least on the hearing of the appeal, the only allegation pursued was the alleged failure of the appellant to provide him with an alternative work platform so that he was not required to stand on top of the load while tensioning the chains. 7 The proceedings were heard by Acting Judge McGrowdie who on 19 September 2006 concluded that the appellant owed the first respondent a duty of care to take reasonable steps to provide him with a safe system of work upon its premises and that it had failed to do so knowing that there existed a risk of injury to the first respondent as in fact had materialised.

Furthermore, the Tribunal was accused of failing to consider all aspects of the appellants' claims, particularly their main problems in China, and not providing the appellants an opportunity to put their case forward.",commonwealth,CGD16 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2017] FCA 1236," 4. The [T]ribunal in their decision has admitted that the petitioners were persecuted in China. Which means the [first appellant] may be persecuted by the Chinese Government. Then obviously it is a grave concern for the [appellants] to live anywhere in China without harm or unnoticed by the Chinese Government. Although banned by regulations, retaliation against petitioners by government officials reportedly continued. The [T]ribunal should have full grasp of the information before it raise the issue in the hearing. The [T]ribunal failed to send a copy of the information to the [appellant] to comment on prior to the hearing.

Furthermore, they must disclose their financial or other interest in that business to any client who deals with the other business in the course of dealing with the solicitor.

Conducting another business (1) A solicitor who engages in the conduct of another business concurrently, but not directly in association, with the conduct of the solicitors legal practice must – (a) ensure that the other business is not of such a nature that the solicitors involvement in it would be likely to impair, or conflict with, the solicitors duties to clients in the conduct of the legal practice; and (b) maintain separate and independent files, records and accounts in respect of the legal practice and the other business; and (c) disclose the solicitors financial or other interest in that business to any client of the solicitor who, in the course of dealing with the solicitor, deals with the other business; and (d) cease to act for the client if the solicitors independent service of the clients interest is reasonably likely to be affected by the solicitors interest in the other business.

This view was influenced by the reference in the Corporations Act that includes within the concept of a ""demand"" one that is a ""purported demand"". However, this conclusion was drawn in the context of winding up proceedings where it was no longer open to set aside the statutory demand, and the presumption of insolvency had already arisen. It does not necessarily apply to a timely application to set aside a demand.",new_south_wales,In the matter of Unity Resources Group Australia Pty Limited [2015] NSWSC 1174,"8. Holmes J’s conclusions in McDermott Projects followed dicta in this Court of Santow J (as he then was) in Dolvelle v Australian Macfarms Pty Limited (1998) 43 NSWLR 717; 28 ACSR 175 (leave to appeal refused: Australian MacFarms Pty Limited v Dolvelle Pty Limited and Anor Matter No Ca 40379/98 [1998] NSWSC 480 (Sheller and Stein JJA)). However, that was a rather different case, because the question arose not on an application to set aside a demand, but in winding up proceedings. As it was no longer open to set aside the statutory demand, the presumption of insolvency had already arisen unless it could be established that the demand was no demand at all. His Honour held that the requirement of exact coincidence of date for verification of the statutory demand, though important, was not to be treated as such an essential integer of a demand that its absence meant that there was no demand at all. That view was no doubt also influenced by the reference in the Corporations Act that has the effect of including within the concept of a ""demand"" one that is a ""purported demand"". In my view, it does not follow that the same approach is to be taken on a timely application to set aside a demand. Moreover, particularly in the context of a national law such as the Corporations Law, a Judge at first instance should follow the intermediate appellate court of another State on the same legislative provision, at least unless satisfied that that decision is plainly wrong, which, far from being the case, I am satisfied is plainly correct."

The new affidavit by Mr Hockings is, in part, a more detailed description of the nature and scope of the retainer and the work done. 58 It seems to me that the affidavits of Mr Hockings and Ms McMahen are properly evidence in reply, and ASIC should be permitted to read them. ASIC's evidence in chief gave some information about PwC's role and work, by the annexure of the reports to Mr Hockings' first affidavit. But the first affidavit does not give detail as to PwC's role, beyond what is said in the reports, because that became an issue only when it was canvassed in Mr Rich’s affidavit in a manner that ASIC says is incorrect. Further, Mr Rich has given evidence of a conversation with a PwC representative that ASIC could not be expected to anticipate. ASIC should be allowed to adduce evidence in reply, partially contradicting and partially qualifying Mr Rich's evidence as to the PwC retainer and the conversation. In my view the whole of both affidavits should be permitted as evidence in reply. "
What events led to the death of Mr Sthapit in the case of R v Tabalbag [2016] NSWSC 1570?,"In the case of R v Tabalbag [2016] NSWSC 1570, Mr Tabalbag became suspicious when he checked the location of Ms Rebucas's iPhone and found it was still at their apartment when she should have been at cooking school. He returned to the apartment and found Ms Rebucas and Mr Sthapit in bed together. In response, Mr Tabalbag grabbed a chef’s knife and stabbed Mr Sthapit multiple times, leading to Mr Sthapit's death shortly afterwards.",new_south_wales,R v Tabalbag [2016] NSWSC 1570,"6. On the morning of Monday 11 November, Mr Tabalbag got up early, and left for work a little before 7 o’clock, as was his habit. Ms Rebucas was still asleep. Later in the morning there was an exchange of sms messages between them, largely concerning relatively trivial matters. On all accounts, this was a regular routine they had. During the morning Mr Tabalbag checked the location of Ms Rebucas’s iPhone. Given their previous messages, there was no doubt that she had it with her. Yet the app showed that the phone was still at the Darling Point apartment at a time when Ms Rebucas should have been at her cooking school. This raised Mr Tabalbag’s suspicions, so he gave his employer an excuse as to why he had to go home, and he drove back to the apartment building, parking his car nearby. 7. When Mr Tabalbag reached the apartment itself he heard some noises inside. He opened the door and saw Ms Rebucas and Mr Sthapit, both naked, in bed having sexual intercourse. When they realised that Mr Tabalbag was there, Mr Sthapit ran into the bathroom and closed the door. Mr Tabalbag grabbed a chef’s knife, which was lying on top of a cupboard near the door. He broke open the bathroom door, and stabbed Mr Sthapit many times, to various parts of his body. The attacks continued after Mr Sthapit ran into the bedroom. As a result Mr Sthapit died shortly afterwards."

What was Red River's plan for the development of the Liontown and Waterloo deposits as stated in their ASX announcements and confirmed by Mr Palancian's affidavit in the case of Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Ltd v Cromarty Resources Pty Ltd; Cromarty Resources Pty Ltd v Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Ltd (No 2) [2021] NSWSC 1017?,"In the case of Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Ltd v Cromarty Resources Pty Ltd; Cromarty Resources Pty Ltd v Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Ltd (No 2) [2021] NSWSC 1017, it was stated that Red River planned to accelerate production at the Liontown deposit ahead of developing the zinc-rich Waterloo deposit. This was confirmed by the evidence given by Mr Palancian in his Affidavit of 20 May 2020, where he stated that it was his intention at the time of the publication of the ASX announcements to prioritise Liontown over Waterloo, and that this remained his intention. Furthermore, the Waterloo deposit was to be placed on hold.",new_south_wales,Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Ltd v Cromarty Resources Pty Ltd; Cromarty Resources Pty Ltd v Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Ltd (No 2) [2021] NSWSC 1017," “The ongoing exploration success at Liontown has increased potential to develop the deposit, with Red River seeking to accelerate production at Liontown ahead of developing the zinc-rich Waterloo deposit.” 21. This announcement stated, in terms, that Red River proposed to develop Liontown “ahead of” Waterloo. 22. On 18 February 2020, Red River published a further ASX Release stating: “Continued high-grade polymetallic results from Liontown have led Red River to prioritise developing Liontown ahead of the zinc-rich Waterloo deposit, (which will be placed on hold), increasing Red River's mill throughput at Thalanga, as well as gold and silver production. … Red River had previously planned to develop the zinc-rich Waterloo Project as the third mining operation.

He argued that such an order should be made as, on a successful appeal, the costs should follow the event.",commonwealth,Snedden v Republic of Croatia (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 132,"REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 1 The respondent sought an order that the appellant be extradited to the Republic of Croatia. The appellant appealed a decision of a judge of the Court in which his Honour concluded that the appellant did not have an extradition objection within the meaning of the Extradition Act. On appeal, the Court made orders that the appeal be allowed and that the respondent pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal. The appellant now seeks an order that the costs ordered below, that he pay the respondent’s costs, be reversed. He submits that such an order should be made as, on a successful appeal, the costs should follow the event. The respondent opposes a vacation of the order for costs made in its favour by the primary judge. 2 The parties agree that the ground of appeal on which the appellant succeeded was advanced before, but not determined by, the primary judge. The respondent points out that the successful ground was raised before his Honour only at the end of oral argument and in the context that a significant ground of review was abandoned by the appellant only on the second day of the hearing before his Honour, with consequential waste of costs prior to that time. The successful ground was not the subject of oral argument before his Honour. It was not raised in his application for review of the Magistrate’s determination, nor in his detailed written submissions filed prior to the hearing. It was raised in oral submissions in reply and developed in written submissions filed after the hearing."
"In the case of Rossi and Rossi v Pel-Air Aviation Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLC 22, what was the court's opinion on the plaintiffs' claim regarding the rectification of the leased premises?","In Rossi and Rossi v Pel-Air Aviation Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLC 22, the court opined that the plaintiffs had not discharged their burdens of proof in relation to the rectification of the leased premises. The court found it impossible to determine whether the damage that was ultimately rectified was substantially caused during the course of the leases in question. The court also suggested that the need for rectification may have substantially arisen prior to the agreements being entered.",new_south_wales,Rossi and Rossi v Pel-Air Aviation Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLC 22," 43. In my opinion, the major evidentiary hurdle faced by the plaintiffs in relation to this point is that raised concerning the rectification: it is impossible to say whether the damage ultimately rectified was substantially occasioned during the course of the leases in question. Leaving aside any issue of fair wear and tear, it cannot seriously be said that the task of merely cleaning the premises caused them to lie vacant for weeks on end: that is not the plaintiffs’ case at all. On the available evidence, there must be a strong possibility that the need for rectification arose, or substantially arose, prior to the agreements being entered. The “down time” was solely for the purposes of rectification. In my view, therefore, the plaintiffs have not discharged their burdens of proof in relation to this aspect of their claims. Outgoings: rates, taxes, levies 44. Clause 18 of the lease required the tenant to reimburse the landlord for municipal and water rates, strata levies, land tax and insurance. The defendant argues that the documents it tendered in its case, which shows a continuity of registered ownership of the properties by Giuseppe (until his death in 2001) and Filomena Rossi, place the burden of responsibility for payment of the various charges for which reimbursement is sought by the plaintiffs not upon them but upon the registered owner.

The Tribunal had determined that even if Mrs Khawar’s version of the facts was accepted, she would not have established that she was a member of a particular social group.

This decision was handed down on 11 April 2002, that is, after the Full Court decision in Applicant Z, which was handed down on 19 December 2001. 29 Mrs Khawar, a Pakistani woman, applied for a protection visa. She claimed that her husband had assaulted her violently on a number of occasions, that she had complained to the police, that the complaints had not been seriously entertained, and that such lack of response by the authorities was accepted in Pakistani society. The Tribunal did not make findings on these issues because it determined that, even if Mrs Khawar’s version of the facts was accepted, she would not have established that she was a member of a particular social group. The High Court, by majority, held that the Tribunal had erred by failing to embark on the fact finding exercise because, if the facts were as alleged by Mrs Khawar, she may have established membership of a particular social group. 30 Gleeson CJ said at pars 32-35: “32. In my view, it would be open to the Tribunal, on the material before it, to conclude that women in Pakistan are a particular social group."

The defendant also disputed the plaintiff’s assertions of duplication.",new_south_wales,Clarence Street Pty Ltd v ISIS Projects Pty Limited [2007] NSWSC 509," 14 The plaintiff submits that there has been substantial duplication and overlapping in the defendant’s evidence, and that “[t]he number and scope of affidavits filed, served and relied on by [the defendant] in relation to the Motion is clearly unreasonable having regard to the nature and extent of the application.” (written submissions on costs dated 10 April 2007, para 16). 15 The defendant’s primary position is that the affidavits to which the plaintiff refers go to the quantum of the further security and are therefore of no present relevance (because of its position on the previous issue). Since I have accepted that the present costs order should be limited so as in effect to exclude any costs relating to the preparation of quantum evidence, that submission must be accepted. 16 The defendant nonetheless takes issue with the plaintiff’s assertions of duplication, and its submissions in support of that assertion. I do not propose to deal with the competing submissions. Firstly, I see little point in deciding a dispute that has no present dispositive significance. Secondly, if the dispute remains live, its decision will be facilitated by a consideration of the referee’s report. Rejected evidence 17 The plaintiff submits that the costs order should be moulded to take account of the fact that I rejected some paragraphs of the defendant’s evidence, and directed the parties to seek to reach agreement on the extent to which the application of the principle underlying those rulings would affect other parts of the defendant’s evidence. Thus, it says, the defendant should not have all its costs. "

What is the distinction between the purpose of a provision and its effect or likely effect according to Australian Commonwealth law?,"According to the decision in Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2003] FCA 388, there is a distinction between the purpose of a provision and its effect or likely effect. The purpose to which a provision refers is the subjective purpose of those engaging in the relevant conduct. The effect or likely effect of a provision is to be determined by reference to what can reasonably be expected to be its consequences. The term ""likely"", as used in this context, means a real chance or possibility, rather than more likely than not. The purpose or effect of a provision is to be assessed at the time the agreement is made or the provision comes into effect.",commonwealth,Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2003] FCA 388," 25 There is a distinction between the purpose of a provision and its effect or likely effect: Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2002) 118 FCR 236, at 266.

What are the two forms of tort as discussed in the case of Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12?,"In the decision of Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12, it was noted that the tort can take two forms. The first form, known as ""targeted malice"", requires proof that the public officer in question acted with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons. The alternate form requires proof that the officer either had actual knowledge that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury, or that the officer acted with reckless indifference to the possibility that his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury.",commonwealth,Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12," (iii) the actions and decisions were done with reckless indifference to the possible lack of powers or invalidity and to the likely injury to the applicants. 121 It is unnecessary for present purposes to discuss the elements of this tort in any detail. They were recently essayed by the Full Court of this Court in Sanders v Snell (No 2) (2003) 130 FCR 149. I would note, though, that the tort can take two forms. In one form (that of “targeted malice”) it must be shown that the public officer in question has acted as such with an actual intent to cause injury to a person or persons. In its alternate form it must be shown either that the officer has actual knowledge both that his or her action was beyond power and would cause or be likely to cause injury or else that the officer has acted with reckless indifference both to the possibility his or her action was beyond power and to the possibility that that action would cause or be likely to cause injury: see generally Sanders v Snell (No 2) at [95]-[100]. 122 The applicants’ contentions in relation to this tort require that close attention be given to the requirements of O 15A r 6 in particular. I emphasise this for this reason."
What were some of the stressful events that the prisoner in R v BUTCHER [2000] NSWSC 92 experienced before the events of the case?,"In R v BUTCHER [2000] NSWSC 92, the prisoner experienced several stressful events before the events of the case. He had been living in the United States for about fifteen years when, in 1994, his mother became terminally ill. He and his wife moved to Australia to care for her. In 1997, they bought a house on the Central Coast which was destroyed by fire within a couple of weeks of their moving in, resulting in significant loss. The prisoner's mother had a bad accident and remained in hospital until her death in January 1998. After his return to Australia, the prisoner established an importing business, which did not do well. These circumstances, along with the loss of his house and difficulties with his business, pressed heavily upon him.",new_south_wales,R v BUTCHER [2000] NSWSC 92," 20 The few years before these events were very stressful for the prisoner. He had been living in the United States of America for about fifteen years when, in 1994, his mother became terminally ill. He and his wife came to Australia to care for her and settled on the Central Coast. In 1997 they bought a house there but within a couple of weeks of their moving in it was destroyed by fire and they lost heavily. The prisoner’s mother had a bad accident and remained in hospital until her death in January 1998. 21 The prisoner worked in the automotive industry during his time in the United States. After his return to Australia he established an importing business, but it did not do well. He and his wife decided to move to Mudgee to make a fresh start. They purchased a piece of land which they intended to clear and use to grow olives. 22 The prisoner’s present wife is his third wife. He maintains good relations with his two former wives and has adult children from one of those marriages. He has a close and supportive family. Notwithstanding that he had those things to be thankful for and that he must have had much to look forward to, he was very depressed at about the time of these events.

Rather, the reasonable reader could understand the first matter complained of to be implying that the claimant acquired his refugee status dishonestly and to infer, from that that the disability pension was also obtained dishonestly. It is permissible for a reader to draw an inference from an implication: see Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (at 167) cited with approval in TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd v Antoniadis at 687 – 688. Nor, with respect to the primary judge, would such an imputation be a product of the reader’s own beliefs and prejudices rather than of what is expressed and implied in the words of it. 36 The first matter complained of is reasonably capable of carrying imputation 3(d). The primary judge erred in striking it out.

In my view, the claims must be construed in the light of the Invention’s purpose of providing a substitute, “of conveniently light and compact form” for a nurses’ lift to a generally standing position, for “infirm and disabled persons generally.” This consideration draws attention to the fact that “the nurses’ lift” is a concept of surely infinite variety, according to the stature, weight and strength of the patient on the one hand, and those characteristics as well as the work methods of the particular nurses concerned on the other hand.

Upon my review of the material before the primary judge I agree with the judge’s finding at J[58] that there is nothing in the material to indicate that the Tribunal was not open to persuasion. Indeed, the fact that prior to the hearing the Tribunal specifically requested the appellant to provide evidence of a certificate of enrolment prior to the hearing, and informed the appellant that the certificate was required for the grant of a visa, show that the Tribunal acted fairly towards the appellant. For the Tribunal to be alive to an issue that was essential to the exercise of its jurisdiction to review, and then to focus on that issue, was not pre-judgment. Nor might a hypothetical fair-minded lay observer who was cognisant of the statutory requirements for the grant of the student visa for which the appellant applied reasonably consider that the Tribunal might have pre-judged the matter or otherwise might not have brought an impartial mind to its review function: see CNY17 at [51], [60] and [92] in relation to imputing knowledge of the statutory scheme to the fair-minded lay observer. 35 For these reasons, there is no substance to the seventh ground of appeal."

The plaintiff (‘the lender’) provides business loans to commercial customers, usually in small amounts ($5,000 to $300,000) and usually to borrowers seeking urgent finance. According to Ms Laura Bryant, who was responsible for ‘loss recovery’ it has a loan book in excess of $500 million, therefore, so far as she is concerned, it is a medium-size lender. The lender dealt with customers either directly (online) or through finance-brokers. 2. On 29 May 2018, Hi-Class Composites Pty Ltd (the borrower) made a written application for a loan, which application was supported by certain bank statements. The purpose of the loan was stated in an Application Data form sourced from Mr Wood, one of the directors and majority shareholder, in the following terms: “The customer has a new contract coming up worth 1.2mill over the year and needs funds to get the project up and running.” 3. The loan agreement was executed by the defendant, who, according to the ASIC register, was the director, secretary, and member of the company. 4. The loan was for the sum of $92,250.

However, it noted that one could not have ""complete confidence"" that the applicant would not again respond by the use of disproportionate violence if provoked by the conduct of another. The Tribunal's finding was that the applicant did not pose an unacceptable risk to the community.",commonwealth,Tran v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 509,"consideration 26 In my view, there is no substance in the first ground of review. Although the Tribunal did not use the word “unacceptable” in referring to the level of risk that the applicant posed to the community, I am satisfied that it did focus sufficiently upon that issue. It concluded at [16] of its reasons for decision that undue weight should not be placed on the risk that the applicant would re-offend. Nonetheless, it noted that one could not have “complete confidence” that the applicant would not again respond by the use of disproportionate violence if provoked by the conduct of another. That finding was plainly open on the evidence and, in my opinion, adequately addressed the overall issue of whether the applicant posed an unacceptable risk to the community. 27 I am also unable to accept Mr Krohn’s contentions in relation to the second ground. There is no doubt that the Tribunal was aware of the fact that Judge McInerney had found that the applicant was remorseful. That conclusion was set out in the extract from his Honour’s sentencing remarks contained at [10] of the Tribunal’s reasons. The weight to be accorded to that factor was a matter for the Tribunal."

"In the context of the New South Wales case X v Department of Human Services, NSW Community Services [2010] NSWADT 222, what is the overriding consideration when dealing with or making decisions in relation to children in out-of-home care?","In the case of X v Department of Human Services, NSW Community Services [2010] NSWADT 222, it was accepted that the overriding consideration when dealing with or making decisions in relation to children in out-of-home care is that the safety, welfare and well-being of the child or young person are paramount. Any service being provided is subject to that overriding consideration.",new_south_wales,"X v Department of Human Services, NSW Community Services [2010] NSWADT 222"," 7 For the purpose of these proceedings, I accept that the Department provides services to birth parents of children in out-of-home care. Those services constitute, at least, maintaining the existing relationship that the child has with their birth parents taking into account the wishes of the child. That much can be gleaned from the provisions of the Children and Young Persons Care and Protection Act 1998 and from the policies of the Department. Of course, the overriding consideration whenever dealing with or making decisions in relation to children in out-of-home care is that the safety, welfare and well-being of the child or young person are paramount. Any service being provided is subject to that overriding consideration. 8 I also accept, for the purposes of these proceedings, that services provided by the Department would extend to seeking views of birth parents and involving birth parents in decision making about their child. The question then is the extent to which the Department’s treatment of Ms X is less favourable than the treatment that was or would be afforded to a person who does not have HIV or Hepatitis C. A possible comparator is the child’s biological father. There was some dispute about whether or not contact with the biological father is supervised or unsupervised. The evidence of the Departmental officer was that contact is supervised as is contact with Ms X, however Mr Chatterjee, on behalf of Ms X, was aware of information which suggested that unsupervised contact with the father may have been permitted. That is a matter which would have to be determined if the matter went to a hearing. However, it does not prevent me from deciding whether or not leave should be granted. "
What were the reasons for the Tribunal's skepticism towards the applicant's allegations of domestic violence in the case of Li v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1527?,"In the case of Li v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1527, the Tribunal expressed skepticism towards the applicant's allegations of domestic violence due to several reasons. These included inconsistencies in the applicant’s account of events reported by Senior Detective Searle, the absence of any complaint of sexual assault when the applicant first spoke to the police, the absence of any medical evidence to support her account of sexual assault, and allegations by the person who accompanied her to the police station that she had been lying. The Tribunal also referred to a statement of Senior Detective Searle doubting the validity of the applicant’s allegations and concluded that the applicant had made them against the nominator in order to remain in Australia. The Tribunal also found no evidence of complaints of violence to the applicant’s friends, was critical of the evidence of the psychologist, and gave little weight to the applicant’s reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety.",commonwealth,Li v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1527," 23 The Tribunal then turned its attention to the domestic violence issue again. It referred to a “full investigation” of the allegations of serious sexual assault undertaken by Victoria Police, to a number of inconsistencies in the applicant’s account of events reported by Senior Detective Searle, the absence of any complaint of sexual assault when the applicant first spoke to the police, the absence of any medical evidence to support her account of sexual assault and to the allegations by the person who accompanied her to the police station that she had been lying. The Tribunal referred to a statement of Senior Detective Searle that she doubted the validity of the applicant’s allegations and concluded that the applicant had made them against the nominator in order to remain in Australia. It referred to the absence of evidence of complaints of violence to the applicant’s friends. The Tribunal was critical of the evidence of the psychologist, describing it as lacking in objective analysis. It attached no weight to the opinion of the domestic violence officer because of an admission by her that all women attending the refuge were believed uncritically. It gave little weight to the applicant’s reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety, which it said could easily have been fabricated for the benefit of a well-intentioned and uncritical support network. 24 The Tribunal continued:"

"In the case of Nederlandse Speciaal Drukkerijen -v- Bollinger Shipping Agency [1999] NSWSC 375, what was the value of Bollinger's claim against the other parties?","In the case of Nederlandse Speciaal Drukkerijen -v- Bollinger Shipping Agency [1999] NSWSC 375, Bollinger's claim against the other parties was not limited to $13,500.00 as initially suggested. In addition to this amount, Bollinger sought to pursue a claim for consequential losses in the sum of NLG$330,000. Given that one NLG was worth approximately $A0.75, Bollinger's claim, assuming it was liable to the Plaintiff in that regard, was of the order of $250,000.",new_south_wales,NEDERLANDSE SPECIAAL DRUKKERIJEN -v- BOLLINGER SHIPPING AGENCY [1999] NSWSC 375," 19 It was at one stage suggested that Bollinger’s claim against the other parties was limited to $13,500.00, a figure mentioned in the New Zealand proceedings Bollinger has commenced, and so removed from the amount of the Plaintiff’s claim as to indicate little likelihood of any claim by Bollinger resulting in significant dispute. However, I am satisfied that Bollinger has, and wishes to pursue, in addition to the claim for $13,500.00, a claim for the consequential losses the Plaintiff seeks against it. A loss adjuster’s report attached to the affidavit of the Solicitor for the Plaintiff of 22 April 1998 indicates these consequential losses are in the sum of NLG$330,000. I think I may take judicial notice of the fact that one NLG is worth something of the order of $A0.75 so that Bollinger’s claim, assuming it is liable to the Plaintiff in that regard, is of the order of $250,000. 20 To the conclusion expressed in paragraph 16 there is however one qualification. The Plaintiff’s opportunity to successfully litigate its claim must not be prejudiced by matters such as jurisdictional limits or time bars which may apply in New Zealand and not in New South Wales. Bollinger did not dispute this reservation and, consistently with the statement that the Plaintiff did not intend to sue anyone in New Zealand, it was not suggested that Pope might be involved in the reservation. There was no attempt by any party to precisely formulate an order to give effect to it and it is of a nature such that the parties should have an opportunity to consider its terms. "

"In the New South Wales jurisdiction, under what circumstances can an order for indemnity costs be made?","According to the decision in the matter of Techfire NSW Pty Ltd [2020] NSWSC 1206, an order for indemnity costs can be made when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to have subjected the defendant to the expenditure of costs. This is not done to punish an unsuccessful plaintiff for persisting with a case that fails, but to compensate a successful defendant fully for costs incurred. Whether an indemnity costs order should be made depends, at least in part, on whether there was a relevant delinquency on the part of the unsuccessful party.",new_south_wales,In the matter of Techfire NSW Pty Ltd [2020] NSWSC 1206," “Costs are awarded on an ordinary basis unless there are exceptional circumstances ….

What was the error of law made by the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) in the case of Khawar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 168 ALR 190?,"In the case of Khawar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 168 ALR 190, Justice Branson found that the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) had made an error of law by reaching a conclusion on the question of whether the applicant’s fear of persecution was for reason of her membership of a particular social group without first identifying the relevant social group, if any, of which the applicant was a member.",commonwealth,Mahmoodi v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1090," 13 It appears that the question as to the application of the decision of the High Court in Applicant A was not argued before his Honour. For reasons given above, I do not consider that it was an issue which the RRT was bound to consider in this case. 14 Another decision which was referred to was the decision of Branson J in Khawar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 168 ALR 190. In that case, her Honour found that the RRT had made an error of law by reaching a conclusion “on the question of whether the applicant’s fear of persecution was for reason of her membership of a particular social group without first identifying the relevant social group, if any, of which the applicant was a member”: at 197. This was one of two grounds on which her Honour remitted the matter to the RRT. That decision is distinguishable from the present because in that case the RRT canvassed a series of possible classifications of social groups, which arguably could be appropriate, but having done so, it failed to make any determination as to which classification of the class or social group applied in respect of the applicant. Justice Branson’s decision was upheld on appeal by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar (2000) 178 ALR 120. The critical issue in the appeal was not the definition of a social group but rather whether the absence of state protection for any particular social group was relevant to the causal link required by the words “for reasons of” in the Convention definition of “refugee”: at 148-149, per Lindgren J. That issue is not central to the present case because the persecution claimed in this matter is said to be carried out by the Taliban itself."

Finally, I should refer to the question of whether two of the Dalmar buildings, the Grace Cottage and the C T Newman Memorial Home, should be demolished. Mr Moore opposes the demolition of those buildings. Mr Brooks is of the view that they may be demolished. The Grace Cottage was erected in 1954. My inspection of this building in the presence of representatives of the parties confirms that it is an undistinguished 1950s building of no great heritage value other than the fact that it is part of the setting for the main heritage buildings. The C T Newman Memorial Home is one of the original buildings erected in 1923. It is in poor condition, has been much altered from its original state and has not been used as a home for children for many years.

The Tribunal also rejected his claim that the brief period of detention or remand and the fine that he would be exposed to, were he found guilty of being an illegal returning departee, would give rise to complementary protection obligations.

Based on those findings, together with its rejection of his claim that the brief period of detention or remand and the fine that he would be exposed to, were he found guilty of being an illegal returning departee, would give rise to complementary protection obligations, it was not satisfied that there were substantial grounds for believing that he would suffer significant harm were he returned to Sri Lanka. 23 I can see no error in the way the trial judge dealt with the arguments put to him by counsel, then representing the appellant, that he repeated in his written submissions on appeal.

Why was the appellant's application for a protection visa rejected in the case of SZICU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1?,"In the case of SZICU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1, the appellant's application for a protection visa was rejected because the delegate of the first respondent believed that since the appellant had no difficulty obtaining an Indian passport, he was ""not of adverse interest to the authorities"".",commonwealth,SZICU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1," 4 The appellant claims that he became an active member of the CPI (ML) and that he coordinated party meetings in his local village, and as a consequence began to attract public attention. In early 2000, he was arrested by local police for his activism. The appellant’s party was banned and he was sentenced to gaol until his release in June 2001. After returning to his village, the appellant could not find his family, and he fled the village to hide in forests where the police would not pursue him. He also claims that he was eventually arrested again in April 2002 and, he says, was subjected to false accusations and brutal attacks by the police. One of these attacks required hospitalisation, but, since the appellant believed that the police asked his doctors to kill him, he ran away. The appellant said that, until 2004, he hid in forests and villages. Ultimately, a friend in the CPI (ML) arranged his visa to escape to Australia. The appellant believes that police and others will kill him anywhere in India if he returns. 5 The delegate of the first respondent refused the appellant’s application for a protection visa. Essentially, the reason for the rejection was that, since the appellant had no difficulty obtaining an Indian passport, he was “not of adverse interest to the authorities”."

As I have observed, the forensic advantage enjoyed by Mr Kalal in cross-examining last will be reversed when the parties come to address. Further, if material emerges in Mr Clarke’s cross-examination that is genuinely new or surprising, it is open to counsel for the other accused to seek leave to ask further questions in cross-examination. This has already happened on one occasion and I allowed further, albeit limited, cross-examination of Witness G on behalf of both Jamil Qaumi and Farhad Qaumi after Mr Clarke had completed his cross-examination: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 32). [11] 16. While I accepted that both the witness and Mr Kalal contend that they were afraid of Farhad Qaumi and acted on his behalf because of their fear, I did not conclude that the witness had an interest consistent with that of the accused (Kalal). The witness’s main interest was to comply with his undertaking to give evidence against the accused and this included giving evidence against Mr Kalal. He did this in providing evidence that supported the Crown case that Mr Kalal was involved in both the Zakaria and Chokolatta Café shootings. Further, I did not form the impression that witness was particularly sympathetic to Mr Kalal’s case."
"In the context of New South Wales law, can a company be bound by a contract independently of the Corporations Act?","No, a company cannot be bound by a contract independently of the Corporations Act. As concluded by Gleeson JA in the matter of Antqip Hire Pty Limited (subject to deed of company arrangement) (in liquidation) [2020] NSWSC 487, the binding force of a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) only arises by reason of section 444G of the Corporations Act.

In paragraph 5D it is alleged that the first respondent breached its duty of care, and in paragraph 5E that as a result the applicants have suffered loss and damage. The pleading does not identify what constitutes the breach, but it is presumably the grant of the lease to Keatsville. As I have said, the first respondent applies to strike out paragraphs 5A to 5E."

What were the declarations sought by Mr Leroy in the matter of Vitale and Vitale (Bankrupts) [2016] FCA 999?,"In the matter of Leroy (Trustee), in the matter of Vitale and Vitale (Bankrupts) [2016] FCA 999, Mr Leroy sought several declarations. Firstly, he sought a declaration that the issue of units in the Vitale Future Generation Trust was beyond power and void. Secondly, he argued that the loan by Vitale Future Generations to Mr and Mrs Vitale to fund the subscription for those units was therefore void, or failed because there was a total failure of consideration. Thirdly, he sought a declaration that the mortgage granted by Mrs Vitale, purportedly to secure the purported loan to Vitale Future Generations, did not secure any debt or obligation, and was accordingly void or should be set aside. His case was not based on the contention that the loan and mortgage were entered into to defraud or defeat creditors, but rather that the issue of the units was not provided for, or properly provided for, in the trust deed, and was therefore beyond power. As a result, the loan that was purportedly made to fund the subscription for those units failed for want of consideration, as did the mortgage that purportedly secured it.",commonwealth,"Leroy (Trustee), in the matter of Vitale and Vitale (Bankrupts) [2016] FCA 999","19 Third, Mr Leroy sought declarations to the effect that the purported issue of units in the Vitale Future Generation Trust was beyond power and void, and that the purported loan by Vitale Future Generations to Mr and Mrs Vitale to fund the subscription for those units was therefore void, or failed because there was a total failure of consideration. 20 Fourth, Mr Leroy sought a declaration that the mortgage granted by Mrs Vitale, purportedly to secure the purported loan to Vitale Future Generations, did not secure any debt or obligation, and was accordingly void or should be set aside. 21 An important point to emphasise about Mr Leroy's case concerning the purported loan to Mrs Vitale and the mortgage of the Caringbah property is that, as originally pleaded, his case was not based on the contention that the loan and mortgage were entered into to defraud or defeat creditors. Rather, in simple terms, Mr Leroy's case was that the issue of the units was not provided for, or properly provided for, in the trust deed, and was therefore beyond power.

"In the case of Wu v R [2016] NSWCCA 96, what was the Crown's argument regarding the discount given for past assistance in Mr Wu's case?","In Wu v R [2016] NSWCCA 96, the Crown conceded that one might infer that the discount given for past assistance in Mr Wu’s case was 5%. However, they argued that even if the relevant discount was 5% for past assistance and 5% for future assistance, this does not demonstrate that there was an error in the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion. The Crown's submission was that, had the judge given a greater discount for the combined assistance and plea, it nevertheless could not have led to a situation where no custodial sentence was imposed at all because that would fail to reflect the principle of general deterrence. The Crown also pointed to the need for the discounted sentence not to be disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender. They argued that it is both artificial and wrong in principle for Mr Wu to seek to demonstrate error by dissecting the combined discount into percentages that were purportedly allowed for the guilty pleas and for assistance.",new_south_wales,Wu v R [2016] NSWCCA 96,"51. In oral submissions, the Crown conceded that one might infer, from the sentence imposed on PR and having regard to the comments that his Honour made in sentencing Mr Wu, that the discount given for past assistance in Mr Wu’s case was 5%, though the Crown makes the point that the sentencing judge did not specify that the discount for the guilty plea was 25% in Mr Wu’s case. The Crown argues that even if the relevant discount was 5% for past assistance and 5% for future assistance, this does not demonstrate that there was an error in the exercise of his Honour’s discretion, noting that the co-offenders’ guilty pleas meant that there was remorse, contrition and willingness to accept responsibility for their offending as Mr Wu did. The Crown’s submission in any event was that, had his Honour given a greater discount for the combined assistance and plea, it nevertheless could not have led to a situation where no custodial sentence was imposed at all because that would fail to reflect the principle of general deterrence. 52. The Crown points to the need for the discounted sentence not to be disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender; and argues that it is both artificial and wrong in principle for Mr Wu to seek to demonstrate error by dissecting the combined discount into percentages that were purportedly allowed for the guilty pleas and for assistance. The Crown refers to what was said by Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher at 227-228 to the effect that matters such as a plea of guilty, expression of contrition and willingness to co-operate with authorities form a complex of interrelated considerations. The Crown submits that the attempt to demonstrate error by isolating the nominated 5% discount for future assistance and then considering the adequacy of that component of the sentence alone is also wrong in principle."

Therefore, there is no duty arising from the language of the statute which it could be said the Board has refused to perform.",commonwealth,Schulz v Medical Board of Queensland [2001] FCA 1771," 11 Section 33(2) does provide the Board with power, inter alia, not to impose a condition which had been imposed by the disciplinary authority in the other State. The Board did not exercise that power in this case and it seems clear enough that its resolution merely recorded, in a formal way, the effect that s 33(1) had had. It could not therefore be said to have made a decision in the exercise of the powers given to it by statute, such as would give jurisdiction to the Tribunal under s 25(1) AAT Act. It remains to consider whether the Board can be said to have failed to consider the exercise of its discretion in his favour. The contention assumes the existence of an obligation to do so. 12 There is nothing in s 33 which, in my view, can be read as requiring the Board to consider whether or not to impose a condition in every case. To the contrary, that would appear to cut across the intended, automatic, operation of s 33(1).

On 15 March 2006 the deceased signed his new will, which left the overwhelming bulk of his estate to Ms Justins, thereby reducing substantially the legacy to his daughters in favour of the appellant. 19 On 19 March 2006 Ms Jenning had a dinner with the deceased and Ms Justins. She reminded them that, because of the foul taste of Nembutal, it was necessary to take an anti-nausea drug some days before consuming the Nembutal in order to ensure that the drug was swallowed without vomiting. Between 20 March 2006 and the date of his death on 22 March, the deceased took Maxolon, an anti-nausea drug, twice a day. 20 It was accepted at the trial that, although the indictment only charged murder and, in the alternative, aiding and abetting suicide, it was implicit in the indictment that the alternative of manslaughter was available.

On the contrary, the court found significant inconsistencies in the evidence of the applicant, particularly in response to the statement by Mr Maiolo about the works being done on the premises. The court also found it highly improbable that Mr Maiolo, who is semi-retired and over 65, would have volunteered to remove dirty oil in a bucket, as alleged by the applicant.",new_south_wales,Gani v Maiolo [2011] NSWADT 219,"33In the written submissions of Mr Kennedy on behalf of the Applicant he calls into question the credibility of Mr Maiolo and makes reference to inconsistencies in Mr Maiolo's oral evidence whilst under cross examination. 34I do not accept that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of Mr Maiolo and if I am wrong and there were, they do not in my opinion reflect unfavourably on the credibility of Mr Maiolo. On the other hand, there were significant inconsistencies in the evidence of the Applicant in particular in the Applicant's response to the statement by Mr Maiolo about the works being done on the premises. For example Annexure ""G"" to the Affidavit of Mr Maiolo (paragraph 26) is a letter from Commercial Combined Catering relating to the San Remo coffee machine. It states that the coffee machine was inspected on 15 May 2010 at 11:00 am and the words are ""Checked: Steam pressure, water pressure, coffee extraction and hot water temperature. Coffee machine is in perfect working order"". It is signed by a technician. It is not merely a cleaning report as alleged by the Applicant, it is as stated by Mr Maiolo to be a certifying report. 35Further, Mr Maiolo is semi-retired and of an age greater than 65. Mr Maiolo vehemently denied that he volunteered to put the dirty oil in a bucket and take it away. Given the denial in the witness box and his general demeanour such a proposition put forward by the Applicant regarding the removal of the dirty oil in a bucket by Mr Maiolo is in my view highly improbable. I do not accept that Mr Maiolo made such a statement regarding the oil and consequently the non-working of the grease trap, as opposed to saying that it requires simply cleaning and replacing the filter."

"What is the test to determine if a bankrupt person can prosecute an action for personal injury or wrong done to himself, as per the judgment of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux [No 2] (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721?","According to the judgment of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux [No 2] (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721, the test to determine if a bankrupt person can prosecute an action for personal injury or wrong done to himself is whether the damages or part of them are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property.",commonwealth,Rana v Musolino [2010] FCA 476," However, the words cannot be taken in isolation. They must, in accordance with the ordinary canons of construction, be read in the context in which they appear. The meaning of the expression, taken from that context, has been explained in numerous cases. In Australia, the classic expression is that contained in the judgment of Dixon J in Cox v Journeaux [No 2] (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721. Speaking of the appellant in that case, Dixon J said: ""... He is a bankrupt and there is no prospect of his satisfying any order for costs made against him in this, or as I infer, in previous litigation. Notice was given under sec 63(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1933 to the official receiver requiring him to elect to prosecute or discontinue the action and he has elected not to prosecute it. The plaintiff says that he himself is entitled to prosecute it under the proviso as an action for personal injury or wrong done to himself. The test appears to be whether the damages or part of them are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property.

ANZ produced documents sought by the First ANZ Subpoena and general access orders were granted on 21 January 2021.

ANZ continued to produce documents in response to either or both of the First ANZ Subpoena and Second ANZ Subpoena until 11 March 2021. 39. The documents produced by ANZ in response to the First ANZ Subpoena and Second ANZ Subpoena appear, at least prima facie, to corroborate Blue Mirror's assertions that the various payments set out at [11]–[12] in fact occurred. Blue Mirror also submitted that it was only after ANZ produced documents on 5 March 2021 that it was able to trace properly the movement of funds to and from Tan & Tan, Anthony and ACC and thus, properly understand the causes of action it had available to it against them."
