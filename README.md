# Enhancing-Winnie

This study enhances "Winnie," a system designed to provide legal assistance in Uganda, by integrating advanced NLP technologies. The project focuses on improving bilingual legal query processing through a pipeline that combines speech-to-text, text-to-speech, translation, and large language models (LLM). The repositor will include all the key files needed to operate the pipeline.
