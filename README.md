# Enhancing-Winnie

This project enhances "Winnie," a system developed for providing legal assistance in Uganda, by integrating advanced NLP technologies. It aims to enhance bilingual legal query processing using a pipeline that incorporates speech-to-text, text-to-speech, translation, and large language models (LLMs). The repository contains all the essential files needed to run the pipeline.
